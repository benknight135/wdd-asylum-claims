# Spotlight on asylum claims

This is part of the Women Driven Development hackathon, [#TechItForward with Pride](https://womendrivendev.org/events).

Proposed by [Megan Stodel](https://meganstodel.com), this project aims to look at outcomes of asylum claims made the grounds of sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI).

Our first challenge is to collate from the government website the decision documents of SOGI-related cases. Our current approach relies on a web scraper using lots of regular expressions. This involves parsing the contents of decision documents to classify them as *successful* or *unsuccessful* (or *abandoned/withdrawn*, i.e. no decision), and then identifying the subset of those cases that are SOGI-related.

Looking forward, we would like to consider the possibility of a machine learning approach: replacing the regular exprssions with a model trained to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful cases, and identify those that are SOGI related.

## Data

The project focuses on better understanding the outcomes of asylum claims made by people on the grounds of sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI), using two key sources: 

* [Decisions posted by the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)](https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/utiac)
* Official statistics: [Asylum claims on the basis of sexual orientation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-year-ending-september-2018/experimental-statistics-asylum-claims-on-the-basis-of-sexual-orientation)

## Project management

The hackathon was on Friday, 26th July 2019. We continue to work on it.
