* [Decisions posted by the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)](https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/utiac)
* Official statistics: [Asylum claims on the basis of sexual orientation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-year-ending-september-2018/experimental-statistics-asylum-claims-on-the-basis-of-sexual-orientation)
