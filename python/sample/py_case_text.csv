This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Graves promulgated on 18th January 2019. Judge Graves dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent dated 23rd May 2018 to refuse to issue him a residence card on the basis that the appellant had a retained right of residence. There is no appearance today by the appellant or his representative. The Tribunal received an e-mail sent on 25th April 2019 at 2305 hours from City Heights Solicitors indicating that they were not instructed for advocacy at the Upper Tribunal for the error of law hearing. The letter states, ""Though we have attempted to contact the appellant in order to seek instruction however were unable to do so."" I am satisfied that the appellant has been informed of the date, the time and the location of his hearing. I am satisfied that there is no good reason for the appellant's absence. In these circumstances I consider it appropriate, having regard to the overriding interest in Rule 2 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008, and having regard to all the circumstances of this appeal holistically considered, that it is appropriate to proceed with the appeal. 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born in 1990. He entered the United Kingdom at some point in 2009. He claims to have met and commenced a relationship with a Polish national whom he married on 17th December 2012. The respondent must have been satisfied both that the Polish national was exercising treaty rights and that there was a genuine marriage because the appellant was granted a residence card based on his relationship with the Polish national on 22nd February 2013. 3. The relationship between the appellant and his spouse deteriorated and they stopped living together in February 2014. Divorce proceedings were initiated and the Decree Absolute was issued on 6th November 2015. This date is relevant because the appellant and his spouse were married for less than three years by the time the marriage came to an end. The appellant was arrested on suspicion of drug related activity in October 2015 and he was remanded in custody until May 2016. He was ultimately released and, although later recalled to custody, I understand that no charges have been brought and that he has no criminal convictions. He was however detained for some five to six months after the divorce. It is clear that he would have been unable to undertake any employment for that period. He claims to have started work in October 2016 and the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal does contain wage slips confirming such employment. 4. The appellant applied on 8th February 2018 for a residence card claiming to have a retained right of residence. This was refused by the respondent on 23rd May 2018. The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant was working or exercising rights under the treaties after the date of divorce. The respondent noted that the marriage had not lasted three years before the divorce was finalised. 5. The Secretary of State's decision attracted a right of appeal. The appeal was listed at Hatton Cross for 15th January 2019. At the hearing there was no attendance by the appellant or his solicitors. The First-tier Tribunal received a letter dated 14th January 2019 from Taj Solicitors stating ""we refer to the above hearing and write to inform you that we are not instructed to attend the hearing which is scheduled to take place on 15th January 2019. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause."" The judge noted that the solicitors had come off the record the day before. It is not apparent from the letter that Taj Solicitors had indeed 'come off the record', only that they were not instructed to attend the hearing. The First-tier Judge was satisfied that the appellant had been informed of the hearing and had provided no reason for his non-attendance or no grounds for an adjournment. The judge, making reference to the Procedure Rules, concluded it was not in the interests of justice to adjourn and proceeded to hear submissions from the Presenting Officer and to determine the appeal. The judge correctly set out the burden and standard of proof and accurately summarised the relevant law. Under the heading ""My findings"" the judge was satisfied that the appeal had to be dismissed. The judge noted that the married had not lasted three years at the date of the divorce and that the requirements under Regulation 10 of the EEA Regulations were not met. The judge was not satisfied that the sponsor had lived in the UK for at least one year of the marriage. The judge was not satisfied that the appellant had established that he was present in the UK exercising treaty rights between the divorce petition being filed and the Decree Absolute and the judge was not satisfied that the appellant had undertaken any employment or otherwise exercised the equivalent of treaty rights from the point of divorce onwards. In relation to the last finding the judge noted that the appellant himself declared that he was in prison between October 2015 and May 2016 and that he only started work in October 2016. The judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a right of residence such that a residence card should be issued.6. The grounds of appeal, presumably settled by the appellant's present representatives, City Heights Solicitors, contend that he was taken unwell before the First-tier Tribunal hearing, that he decided he was not in a fit state to attend the hearing and that he provided medical evidence to Taj Solicitors in advance of the hearing and instructed Taj Solicitors to adjourn the appeal hearing. The grounds contend that Taj Solicitors failed to apply for the adjournment and instead withdrew their instructions the day before the hearing. According to the grounds the appellant was completely unaware of this and was under the impression that the hearing had been adjourned. On instructions from City Heights Solicitors the appellant is said to have attempted to contact Taj Solicitors on several occasions by phone and e-mail but Taj Solicitors failed to respond. I pause to note the complete absence of any evidence either in relation to the appellant being unwell at or around the date of the First-tier hearing, or of any attempts to contact Taj Solicitors. The grounds first invited the First-tier Tribunal to set aside the judge's decision on the basis that the appellant was not present and was unable to make submissions. Alternatively, the grounds sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that there was a procedural irregularity. The grounds contend that the appellant had strong grounds for the grant of an adjournment as he was not medically fit to attend the hearing and assert that Taj Solicitors withdrew their instructions without any justified reason and that the absence of any legal representative prevented the appellant from having a fair hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights. I pause once again to note that Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights does not apply in administrative decisions, although the principles of administrative fairness and procedural fairness inherent on Article 6 do apply to all aspects of the Tribunal Procedure. Permission was granted by Judge Hollingworth on 28th February 2019. Judge Hollingworth stated, ""It is arguable in the light of the circumstances set out in the permission application, the condition of the appellant and the steps taken which are referred to that unfairness has arisen or is capable of being seen to arise."" 7. The appellant's current representatives have provided a bundle of documents for the purposes of the error of law hearing. These replicate the documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal. They include a character reference letter, letters of the appellant's employment from October 2016, evidence of his address, the marriage certificate, the divorce certificate and the appeal documents. They omit to contain any evidence relating to the appellant's state of health at the date of the First-tier hearing and any evidence of any attempt to contact Taj Solicitors. I am not satisfied that there has been any procedural impropriety or procedural unfairness in the First-tier Tribunal's decision. This is because the appellant could have provided medical evidence that he claims was given to Taj Solicitors in support of this appeal. There is no evidence of any sort in the Tribunal bundle. Moreover, the appellant has made serious criticism of his previous representatives. Following HG (Conduct of Previous Solicitor - Procedure) Turkey [2004] UKIAT 00066, the current representatives should have communicated the grounds of appeal and any supporting documents to the former representatives and asked them to confirm, deny or comment. There is no evidence before me that there has been any attempt to communicate with Taj Solicitors and there is no evidence to support the very serious allegation that Taj Solicitors failed to act on the appellant's instructions to request an adjournment and came off record instead.8. In determining whether the failure by the judge to adjourn the First-tier hearing was lawful I have had regard to Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418, a decision of the former President of the Upper Tribunal promulgated in September 2014. Having regard to the principles set out in that decision I am entirely unpersuaded that the appellant was denied a fair hearing, and that the failure by the judge to adjourn or to even consider adjourning the hearing was not, on any view, one that led to unfairness. Even if I am mistaken in terms of the failure to adjourn I am entirely satisfied that the failure to adjourn the hearing could not have made any material difference to the First-tier Judge's conclusion. This is for two very simple reasons. The appellant had not been married for three years and the appellant had not worked for a continuous period after the divorce. It is impossible for the appellant to have met the requirements for the grant of a residence card on the basis that he had a retained right of residence. The grounds wholly fail to engage with these unassailable conclusions of the First-tier Judge. The judge granting permission should have had regard to whether the appeal could, on any rational view, have succeeded. For the reasons given the appeal could not have succeeded and I find that there is no error of law such that the decision ought to be set aside. I therefore dismiss the appeal. No anonymity direction is made. 10 May 2019Signed DateUpper Tribunal Judge Blum",2019-05-14
1,EA/03465/2018,"Upper Tribunal(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: EA/03465/2018THE IMMIGRATION ACTSHeard at Manchester CJCDecision & Reasons Promulgated On 7 May 2019 On 14 May 2019BeforeUPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE PLIMMERBetweenNOUMAN CHAUDHARY AppellantandTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT RespondentRepresentation:For the Appellant: Ms Akhtar, CounselFor the Respondent: Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who has divorced his spouse, an EEA national. 2. He has appealed against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal ('FtT') sent on 13 July 2018. There was only one issue in dispute before the FtT. This is because the respondent accepted that all the requirements of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 ('the 2016 Regs') were met, save regulation 21(5). In particular, the respondent did not accept that the appellant provided a valid national identity card or passport in the name of his EEA national ex-wife. 3. In grounds of appeal prepared on behalf of the appellant it was argued that the FtT erred in law in requiring him to provide a certified copy of identity documents given the particular circumstances of this case. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam in these terms:""It is arguable that the judge did not consider whether in the context of previous applications and the arguable acceptance of the EEA national's identity, the appellant had satisfied 21(5) of the 2016 Reg in submitting photocopies of documents or the materiality if any of Reg 42."" 4. At the hearing before me, Mr McVeety pointed out the application to appeal to the FTT was four days late. After hearing from both representatives I indicated that in so far as it was necessary to do so I granted an extension of time because it was in the interests of justice to do so. Although the explanation provided by the appellant's solicitors for the late appeal was difficult to follow, it was sufficiently clear that this was not attributable to the appellant. The delay was not lengthy and it is in the interests of both parties for the matter to be resolved promptly. 5. Mr McVeety did not dispute that the FTT failed to engage with regulation 42. The FtT's decision clearly contains an error of law as identified by Judge McWilliam when granting permission to appeal. The 2016 Regs make it clear at regulation 42 that the respondent may accept alternative evidence of identity and nationality ""where the person is unable to obtain or produce the required document due to circumstances beyond the person's control"". The FTT completely failed to consider whether this appellant was unable to provide his wife's passport due to circumstances beyond his control and failed to consider whether the alternative attested copy of the ex-spouse's passport was sufficient in the circumstances. 6. Both parties agreed that I should remake the decision myself and there was no need to provide any further evidence. The appellant's marriage irretrievably broke down and there was an understandable lack of amicable relations between him and his wife to persuade her to submit her passport. The appellant explained that it had been submitted to the respondent and other government agencies previously. The delay in returning the ex-wife's passport caused her inconvenience including preventing her from travelling. The appellant has provided a plausible reason for his ex-wife being unwilling to provide her passport. This is beyond the appellant's control. There was clear evidence that the appellant had previously been able to submit identity evidence in respect of the self-same EEA national, which has not been disputed. 7. Mr McVeety invited me to consider the appellant's explanation in the round. I have done so and decided there is no reason to dispute the appellant's claim that his ex-wife refused to provide her passport to enable him to produce it and this was beyond his control. There is however alternative evidence of nationality in the form of an attested copy of her passport.8. The decision of the FtT contains an error of law and is set aside. I re-make the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal.Signed UTJ Plimmer DatedUpper Tribunal Judge Plimmer 7 May 2019",2019-05-14
2,DA/00360/2017," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: DA/00360/2017 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 1 May 2019 On 14 May 2019      Before THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SOOLE (SITTING AS A JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL) UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE McWILLIAM Between THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Appellant and MR JOHN ROSS BLE (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE) Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer For the Respondent: Mr K Smyth, Counsel instructed by Kesar & Co Solicitors DECISION AND REASONS 1. We shall refer to the Respondent as “the Appellant” as he was before the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”). He is a citizen of France. His date of birth is 23 December 1996. The Appellant appealed against the decision of the Respondent to make a deportation order on 12 June 2017 under Regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”). His appeal was allowed by FTT Judge Kaler, following a hearing on 30 November 2018 in a decision that was promulgated on 7 December 2018. The Secretary of State was granted permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer on 4 January 2019. The background 2. The Appellant has an appalling criminal history as recorded by the judge at paragraphs 3 to 7 of the decision. In short, between 2 May 2012 and 23 August 2016 he amassed ten convictions for sixteen offences, two of which are offences against the person and two involve weapons, including firearms. On 31 January 2014 he was convicted of aggravated burglary of a dwelling with intent to commit an assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH). These offences were the trigger which led to the Secretary of State making a deportation order (“the trigger offences”). The Appellant was sentenced to five years imprisonment for aggravated burglary and two years for ABH, to run concurrently. He was aged 17 at the date of sentence and aged 16 when the offences were committed. The decision of the FTT 3. It was agreed by the parties that the 2016 Regulations apply to the Appellant and that because of the time that he has been in the UK, he benefits from the highest level of protection with reference to Regulation 27 (4). Thus, a decision to remove him cannot be made unless justified on imperative grounds and public security. It was accepted by the Secretary of State that the Appellant has been here since the age of 2. 4. The judge summarised the details of the trigger offences, having regard to the sentencing judge’s remarks. The FTT described the offences as “appalling”, noting from the judge’s sentencing remarks that the Appellant and others entered the home of the victim wearing balaclavas and armed with weapons, the Appellant with a gun and one of his accomplices with a Stanley knife. The Appellant kicked a middle-aged woman in the face and she was knocked unconscious. This was committed in the presence of the victim’s 17- year old daughter. The sentencing judge described “dreadful damage” to the victim’s face and eye and psychological injuries to both the victim and daughter. The offence was described by the sentencing judge as extremely serious. The sentencing judge considered two previous offences of robbery committed by the Appellant. He had been given what the sentencing judge described as a chance with the imposition of a youth rehabilitation order and latterly a detention and training order. The sentencing judge said that the offence was a category 1 offence because of greater harm and the higher culpability of the Appellant. He recorded the only mitigation as “a degree of remorse.” He observed that had the Appellant been an adult the starting point would have been a ten-year sentence. 5. The Appellant was released on license on 2 August 2016. On 23 August 2016 he committed two offences of assaulting police officers. He was convicted of a third assault on a PC on 5 January 2017. He was recalled to prison on 23 August 2016 because he failed to comply with the rules of approved premises. The Respondent before the FTT relied on a report prepared by an offending supervisor and his conclusion; namely that the Appellant had not rehabilitated, continued to exhibit offending behaviour and was likely to reoffend. The offending supervisor expressed concerns that the Appellant was involved in serious organised crime. He could not provide a risk management plan but would be able to manage the risk presented by the Appellant whilst in the community. 6. Whilst the Appellant was in prison in 2018 there were three adjudications against him. On 4 January he was found to have assaulted a prisoner. On 5 May he was found to have obstructed officers from performing their duties. It is recorded that on this occasion he was extremely aggressive and refused staff instructions. On 30 June he was found to have damaged property when using a chair to fight another prisoner. In addition to which he was found with an improvised weapon. There were many other incidents involving violence recorded against the Appellant. These were noted by the judge in her decision. 7. The judge heard evidence from the Appellant and his mother. She found that the Appellant’s behaviour since the trigger offence had been appalling, that the evidence did not show that he had learned his lesson or that he is determined to mend his ways and that there was little prospect of rehabilitation. She expressed fear that he would continue to offend. She found that the Secretary of State had not established that the Appellant is a member of a gang or that he had been involved in serious crime. 8. At [20] the judge turned her attention to whether the Secretary of State had established imperative grounds of public security. She found that the risk of reoffending was high. She found that the Appellant had a propensity to reoffend and that he presents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the public (see Regulation 27(5)(c)). She found that had the Appellant been entitled to a lower level of protection, namely that under Regulation 27(3) (a relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person with a right of permanent residence under Regulation 15 except on serious grounds of public policy and public security) she would have no doubt that the test would have been satisfied. 9. At [23] the judge observed that there is no guidance in the Regulations as to what is meant by “imperative grounds of public security.” She directed herself on a number of authorities between [23] and [31]. Those authorities are PI v Oberbürgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/09), Land Baden-Württemberg v Tsakouridis (Case C-145/09), the Opinion of Advocate-General Bot: PI v Oberbürgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/09), KA and Others v Belgische Staat (Case C-82/16), LG and CC (EEA Regs: residence; imprisonment; removal) Italy [2009] UKAIT 00024, MG and VC (EEA Regulations 2006; “conducive” deportation) Ireland [2006] UKAIT 00053, VP (Italy) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 806; and Jarusevicius (EEA Reg 21 – effect of imprisonment) [2012] UKUT 00120(IAC). 10. The judge went on to conclude as follows: - “32. In all the cases where imperative grounds have been found to exist relate to offences that disclosed particularly serious characteristics. The (sic) include offences concerning issues of national security, importing and supplying high quantities of drugs, serious incidents of violence and systematic abuse of children. 33. My assessment establishes that serious grounds of public policy and public security have been established. However, having taken guidance from the established caselaw (sic), I am not satisfied that the higher test of imperative grounds of public security have (sic) been made out. Invading a person’s home, which is what this Appellant did, is always a serious matter and is particularly repugnant to public order and assaulting a woman in such premises is deplorable. His behaviour towards this victim and the other members of the public and public servants has been disgusting, but it does not establish imperative grounds. The Appellant is not a terrorist and although he has used a firearm to threaten people, he has not seriously injured or killed anyone. Although I fear that the Appellant may be capable of committing more series (sic) offences if he does not change his ways and behaviour, I do not find that the test of imperative grounds has been met.” The grounds of appeal 11. The grounds are diffuse and insufficiently particularised. Mr Kotas’ oral submissions were more focussed. He asserted that the judge misdirected herself and artificially reduced the scope of the analysis of whether there were imperative grounds. Mr Kotas stated that the judge effectively boxed herself in when assessing whether there were imperative grounds. In support of this he drew our attention to [19] and [32] of the decision. He submitted that Judge Kaler in her analysis was looking for the type of offences that could satisfy the test rather than looking at matters in the round. He drew our attention to [33] where the judge said that the Appellant is not a terrorist. 12. Mr Kotas submitted the offence committed by the Appellant was a serious, violent offence. The judge was wrong in her assessment of imperative grounds. The assessment does not do justice to the very serious threat posed by the Appellant. Mr Kotas drew our attention to parts of the OASys Report to support his assertion that the judge vastly understated the risk when she concluded, at [33], that the Appellant “may be capable of committing more serious offences …”. He drew our attention to page 7 of the assessment where there is a risk assessment expressed as a percentage. He has been assessed at 74% risk of reoffending within one year and 85% within two years. He drew our attention to other aspects of the report including page 11 which states that the Appellant has been moved to fourteen prison institutions during his sentence based on his behaviour towards others or safety concerns. It is recorded that he stated that he always makes the first move with regards to assaulting others. 13. The author of the OASys assessment concluded that the Appellant holds underlying beliefs and attitudes that contribute to his offending behaviour and that he was unable to show any regret or compassion for the victim of the index offence. It also refers to physical altercations with prison staff. At page 33 it is noted that there are concerns about the Appellant’s control and disruptive behaviour. At page 34 (R10.3) our attention was drawn to the author’s consideration of when the risk is likely to be greatest and it is recorded that when released into the community the Appellant may seek reprisals against rival gang members. Mr Kotas drew our attention to the assessment of risk (at page 35) which indicates whilst in custody he presents a very high risk to staff. 14. Mr Kotas submitted that the judge did not attach sufficient weight to [33] of the decision letter which indicates that the Appellant has been assessed and subject to the highest level of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA level 3), the purpose of which is the protection of the public. A level 3 assessment indicates that he is considered one of the “critical few” and poses an immediate danger to the public. There was evidence that the judge did not make a global assessment of the risk presented by the Appellant in the context of the evidence as a whole. 15. Mr Smyth made submissions in the context of the Rule 24 response. He argued that the Respondent was attempting to reargue the case. The judge was aware of the risk of reoffending and the future risk posed by the Appellant. She had all material factors in mind. She did not “box herself in” as suggested by Mr Kotas. She applied a global assessment in the absence of strict guidance from the higher courts. Her conclusion was open to her in the absence of irrationality. Conclusions 16. At Regulation 27 thehierarchy of levels of protection based on criteria of increasing stringency is set out. There is a general criterion that removal may be justified “on grounds of public policy, public security or public health”. A more specific criterion is applicable to those with permanent rights of residence. They may not be removed “except on serious grounds of public policy or public security”. The most stringent criterion, applicable to a person “who has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision”, who may not be removed except on imperative grounds of public security”. This reflects paragraph 24 of the preamble and Article 28 of Chapter V1 of the Directive 2004/38/EC. Neither party referred to the Directive. The decision of the judge must be considered in the context of the rights laid down in the Directive and the protection against deportation afforded to EEA nationals. “Imperative grounds” is not defined in the EEA Regulations 2016 or the directive. It may be interpreted more widely than threats to the state or its institutions, and can, for example, include serious criminality, such as drug dealing as part of an organised group. See: Tsakouridis (European citizenship) [2010] EUECJ C-145/09. In LG (Italy) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 190, the court did not attempt to lay down definitive guidance recognising that European Law recognises “an area of discretion” for Member States (Van Duyn v Home Office [1974] ECR 1337 para 18); and that the Directive allows for “imperative grounds” test to be subject to definition by Member States. The Respondent did not draw our attention to a definition. The grounds rely on the case of SSHD v Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ 1245. It is not clear whether this case was brought to the attention of the judge. The relevant paragraphs relied on by the Secretary of State are the following:- “22. Our attention was not drawn to any case in which the CJEU has considered the kind of conduct that is likely to be sufficiently serious to justify deportation of an EEA national who enjoys a permanent right of residence but has not lived in the member state concerned for a period of at least ten years. Ms Chan did, however, draw our attention to the decision in I v Oberbürgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid, in which the claimant had been convicted of multiple offences of sexual abuse, sexual coercion and rape of a 14 year old girl in respect of which he had been sentenced to 7½ years' imprisonment. The CJEU was asked to decide whether the expression ‘imperative grounds of public security’ referred only to conduct which threatened the security of the state itself, its population and the survival of its institutions or was broader in scope. 23. In giving its judgment the court emphasised that member states retain the freedom to determine the requirements of public policy and public security in accordance with their national needs, but that the requirements of the Directive must still be interpreted strictly. Criminal offences which constitute a particularly serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society or which pose a direct threat to the calm and physical security of the population may fall within the concept of ‘imperative grounds of public security’, as long as the manner in which such offences were committed discloses particularly serious characteristics. However, the court also emphasised that even then deportation will not be justified unless the conduct of the person concerned represents a genuine, present threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, which normally implies that he has a propensity to act in the same way in the future (see paragraphs 17-30). 24. … it is clear, as the court confirmed, that the expression ‘imperative grounds of public security’ creates a considerably stricter test than merely ‘serious’ grounds, but since the application of the test is primarily for the member state concerned, which must take into account social conditions as well as the various factors to which the Directive itself refers, the question is likely to turn to a large extent on the particular facts of the case. It would therefore be unwise, in my view, to attempt to lay down guidelines. In the end, the Secretary of State must give effect to the Regulations, which themselves must be interpreted against the background of the right of free movement and the need to ensure that derogations from it are construed strictly. In that context it is worth noting that even in a case where it is considered that removal is prima facie justified on imperative grounds of public security, the decision-maker must consider, among other things, whether the offender has a propensity to re-offend in a similar way (judgment, paragraph 30).” 17. We note that the initial decision of the Respondent was based on the Appellant being entitled to the lowest level of protection. The Secretary of State conceded in a supplementary letter of 21 November 2018 that the Appellant was entitled to the highest level of protection. The decision does not assist with the interrelation of imperative other than by reference to Tsakouridis where it was decided by the ECJ that the definition should not be restricted to attacks on the state but also include serious criminality. 18. The judge accepted that the Appellant presented a high risk of reoffending. She was unarguably wholly aware of the details of the trigger offences, the extent of the Appellant’s criminality and the contents of the OASys Report. These factors led to the Appellant presenting a high risk of the commission of further offences of the same order as the trigger offence. Whilst the judge did not explicitly refer to the MAPPA level 3 assessment, we do not consider that it was necessary for her to do so because she accepted the Respondent’s case that there was a high risk of reoffending and she understood the seriousness of the Appellant’s offences and the risk that he presented. The judge’s finding, at [19], that the Appellant is not part of a gang or involved in serious organised crime was one that was open her. In addition, it was a factor she was entitled to attach weight to when deciding the extent and nature of the threat. Whilst there is reference within the OASys Report to the Appellant being in a gang or involved in serious organised crime, the evidence amounted to unsupported assertions. There is no substance in the Respondent’s ground that the judge did not consider material evidence. 19. The judge set out relevant case law. We do not accept that she artificially and erroneously limited the scope of her assessment of what is capable of establishing imperative grounds which would justify deportation for the purposes of the 2016 Regulations. Her conclusions at [32] do not establish that she wrongly limited the scope of what can constitute imperative grounds. She understood that whilst it includes terrorism it also includes serious criminality falling short of terrorism. What the judge did was to take what limited guidance there is from the case law available. She recognised at [23] that there was no guidance in the Regulations about what is meant by “imperative grounds”. Ultimately, in our view she made an assessment based on the circumstances of the Appellant which is what is required in cases of this nature. 20. The Respondent’s position is that the judge did not properly take into account SSHD v Staszewski. Whilst it is not apparent that her attention was drawn to it, there is nothing in the judgement that would establish that the judge erred in her approach. The observation made by the Court of Appeal at [24] was that it will be unwise to attempt to lay down guidelines and that the relevant question (in this case whether there are imperative grounds of public security to justify the Appellant’s deportation, whilst in the case of Straszewski the issue was whether there were serious grounds) is likely to turn to a large extent on the particular facts of the case. In the absence of specific guidelines and/ or a definition of what constitutes imperative grounds, the judge’s approach to the assessment was correct and her ultimate decision was open to her. 21. Insofar as the grounds rely on the case of Bulale v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 806 they conflate the test of imperative grounds with the test under 27(5)(c) of the Regulations which the judge found had been satisfied in this case, in any event. The judge was satisfied that the Appellant’s conduct represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Indeed, it would be difficult to reach a different conclusion on the evidence before her; however, unless the deportation can be justified on imperative grounds, it is not lawful. 22. The challenge to the decision regarding imperative grounds does not properly identify an error of law. The judge was entitled to conclude that the Appellant’s conduct did not reach the very, very high threshold. In the absence of irrationality (which was not, in any event, pleaded in the grounds of appeal), the decision was open to the judge on the evidence before her. Notice of Decision 23. The decision of the FTT to allow the Appellant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations is lawful and sustainable. The Secretary of State’s application is dismissed. 24. No anonymity direction is made.

3,AA/12467/2015," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: AA/12467/2015 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 17 April 2019 On 14 May 2019      Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MCGEACHY Between T W (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE) Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Miss G Mellon of Counsel instructed by David Benson Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS 1. The appellant appealed against a decision of the respondent dated 14 September 2015 to refuse to grant him asylum. After the appeal had been remitted twice to the First-tier Tribunal the appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Carroll in a determination promulgated on 25 October 2018. After a hearing on 23 January 2019 I set aside that decision and directed that the appeal be heard afresh before me. In these circumstances the appeal came before me on 17 April 2019. 2. In my decision setting aside the determination, which is annexed hereto, I set out the appellant’s immigration history and referred to the medical evidence placed before the First-tier Judge. In paragraphs 25 through 28 of my determination I gave my reasons for setting aside the decision and referred to the reasons for refusal given by the Secretary of State. 3. In drafting this determination I note the terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in KV (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2019] UKSC 10 which was handed down on 6 March 2019, that is two weeks after my decision was promulgated. That judgment dealt with the issue of self-inflicted injury by proxy and, in effect, emphasised that wounding by SIBP was “generally so unlikely” and that an explanation would have to be found for the number of wounds incurred. It was the view of the Supreme Court, endorsing the judgment of Elias LJ that: “… very considerable weight should be given to the fact that injuries which are SIBP are likely to be extremely rare. An individual is highly unlikely to want to suffer the continuing pain and discomfort resulting from self-inflicted harm, even if he is anaesthetised when the harm is inflicted. Moreover, the possibility that the injuries may have been sustained in this way is even likely in circumstances where the applicant would have needed to be anaesthetised. This would in all probability have required the clandestine co-operation of a qualified doctor who would have had to be willing to act in breach of the most fundamental and ethical standards, and who had access to the relevant medical equipment.” 4. The issue of the scars on the appellant’s back therefore becomes a central issue in this appeal. While the respondent has put forward clear reasons why the appellant’s claim is not credible. I have to consider the credibility of the appellant’s claim in the context of the clear direction from the Supreme Court that it would be extremely unlikely that the injuries which the appellant suffered were inflicted by proxy. I would add, of course, that the standard of proof in this asylum claim is that of serious possibility or reasonable likelihood. 5. Both Miss Mellon and Mr Kotas referred to numerous documents including the various medical reports, the letter of refusal, relevant case law including GJ and Others (post-civil war returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] and ME (Sri Lanka) [2018] EWCA Civ 1486 as well as background documentation. The appellant gave evidence regarding his claims of what had happened to him in Sri Lanka before he came to Britain as a student and when he was deported from Martinique. I consider that it is of use if I set out the submissions made to me at the hearing before referring to the documentary evidence. In brief however, in his evidence before me, the appellant relied on two statements and said that he had developed sympathy for Tamils after seeing videos of Tamils being ill-treated. He had helped LTTE members escape from Vavuniya to Chilaw, receiving 50,000 rupees on each occasion. He was helped by his father who was a lorry driver. In all he made five journeys. He had travelled on the last occasion to Vavuniya with a Tamil friend, Ganesh, in his three-wheeler (his tuk-tuk) and while there his mother told him not to return to Chilaw as his father had been picked up at their home and detained and shortly, thereafter, was found dead on the railway line. He believed that his father had been murdered. 6. In March 2009 he was picked up at a checkpoint when with a friend. He stated he had been released in November 2009 after a bribe was paid by his brother but was placed on reporting conditions. He gave details of his leaving through the airport with the help of an agent. He was asked to identify people from photographs. 7. He stated that when deported from Martinique he had been picked up at the airport and handed by immigration to the CID and that it was then found that he was a wanted person so he was taken to a judge’s house because he was wanted and thereafter he was sent to the Welikada Prison. He stated that when he had appeared before the judge he learned that his detention was based on a record on a database that he had helped members of the LTTE and that he had escaped from prison and gone to Britain, that he could be supporting the LTTE from Britain and therefore it was necessary to interview him further. He said he had been shown pictures when in prison and said he did not know the people in the pictures, although he had recognised one person. He said that he was ill-treated while he was being questioned. He stated that he had been released after the intervention of a Member of Parliament but the release had not been legal. There was a record which indicated that he was still imprisoned. He had left on a false passport but which contained a photograph but not his name. 8. In cross-examination the appellant was asked why he had helped the members of the LTTE and he said that he had wanted to help a Tamil friend after seeing videos of ill-treatment. His evidence regarding the contents of the videos was that it showed an atrocity after a bomb had gone off and he mentioned that the LTTE had forced people to join them. One of the videos had shown people being tortured. He then gave details of the money which he had received for transporting Tamils and said that he had helped Tamils because they were “normal people”. 9. Although he was primarily a musician he had also driven a tuk-tuk and he said that his father had helped transport Tamils in his lorry on four occasions, but on the fifth occasion he had been with a Tamil in his tuk-tuk. He was then referred to the report of Dr Leggatt in which Dr Leggatt had said that the appellant had told her that his father was initially keen for the family’s tuk-tuk to be used but that the appellant had made various round trips to Vavuniya to collect Tamil passengers who were escaping the civil war. The appellant emphasised that he had said that his father had helped him. He confirmed that he, but not his father, had been paid and that he had persuaded his father to help. 10. He was referred to a comment that he had made to a doctor that he had been involved in the militia. He stated that that was wrong: what he had said was that he had been detained by the militia in an army camp. He was then referred to a letter from his doctor dated 6 June 2016 which described visits to the doctor in May and June 2016 when he had complained of back pain. Mr Kotas then asked him how it was that if he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder such that he was unable to attend the course for which he had received the student visa in August 2010, he had been able to work in Tesco. He said that he had not worked. It was then pointed out to him that he had attended his doctor in December 2014 when it was said that he had been trapped between two doors in a hospital while delivering pizza. He was asked if he was working then. He was also asked about the fact that at one appointment it was stated that he had been accompanied by his sister. He said he was accompanied by the woman with whose family he was living at that time. He stated that he had been trying to get to Canada because he had been told that he could not succeed in the asylum application here. 11. Having given Mr Kotas further details of his detention at the airport on return in 2015 he was again asked about his attendance at the doctor’s surgery and asked if he had mentioned the scars on his back. He said that he may have talked about it. He was asked why the doctor had not said that he had scars on his back and it was put to him that at that time he had not had scars on his back. 12. He was asked if he had been involved in activity in Britain and he said that he had not and he confirmed to Mr Kotas that he had no evidence that there was an arrest warrant outstanding for him. He said that he was no longer in contact with his mother. He said that he had not instructed a lawyer in Sri Lanka and that one had not been contacted apart from the obtaining of the affidavit from his mother. 13. I asked him: “Is it true when you first saw the doctor here you did not have scars on your back?”. The appellant replied: “I don’t remember I met a doctor in 2015 and I do not remember. I showed the doctor my wounds”. 14. In his submissions Mr Kotas relied on the Reasons for Refusal Letter and asked me to find that the appellant’s claim was inherently implausible and inconsistent with the country guidance in GJ and that in effect the core of the appellant’s claim had not happened. He would therefore not be on risk on return and in that regard he referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in ME (Sri Lanka). He asked me to find the appellant’s story of having watched a number of videos and then decided to assist Tamils to move around was, for a Sinhalese, extremely unlikely unless there was financial motivation. He had not stated at interview why he would assist the Tamils, but only said that he was sympathetic with them and would therefore help them out. Moreover, he had indicated that the money paid related to his father rather than to himself and if there had been a financial remuneration factor surely that would have been mentioned at interview. The appellant had been vague in what he had seen in the videos and there was discrepancies in his claim of how he had moved people around, whether by lorry or in the tuk-tuk. Moreover, he was vague as to how his brother had secured his release – the assertion of how he had been released was really based on convenient happenstance. If it were the case that the appellant had feared returning then surely he would have claimed asylum here before attempting to go to Canada. Mr Kotas also referred to the fact that a doctor had mentioned that he had attended with his sister. 15. He added that the appellant had told the doctor that he was involved with the military and the reality was that he had merely tried to explain that away. His story had changed depending on who he had talked to. 16. The appellant claimed that he had been detained at the airport in 2015 but the independent evidence, set out in GJ was that there were no detention facilities at the airport. Moreover, there was no evidence of a warrant or court order and therefore there was no reason why he should have been on a stop list. He would surely have been allowed to go home. 17. With regard to the appellant’s scarring his assertion was that he had been subjected to repeated burns but when he got out of detention his grounds were only treated with cream. Moreover, when first seen by his doctor he had not had scars although the doctor had examined his back before sending him for an x-ray. This was powerful evidence that there were no scars when he was examined. Surely if he had just had fresh scars he would have asked the doctor to check them over and if the doctor, having examined him had seen them, that would have been mentioned. The only logical conclusion was that he did not have scars when he arrived in Britain and was first seen by a doctor. 18. Moreover, the appellant had not claimed that he had left the country since returning to Britain and therefore the scars could only have been caused by what had happened to him here. He referred to Dr Leggat’s report but asked me to consider that they did not indicate that he had received the injuries in Sri Lanka. The evidence was, he asserted, that the appellant was an economic migrant. 19. Alternatively, he asked me to conclude that taking the claim at its highest and given that there was no evidence of an arrest warrant or that the appellant was on a stop list the only possible reason he could face persecution was because he had helped someone in 2008, which was eleven years ago. He pointed out the appellant had not been involved in politics and there was no evidence of diaspora activities and the reality was the appellant, if returned, was merely just a failed asylum seeker. It may be that he was ill-treated when he had returned because he had used a false passport but that would not be the case on return now as he would be returning on a travel document. There would therefore be no risk on return. 20. In reply Miss Mellon asked me to find that the appellant’s claim was credible. She emphasised that the appellant had been consistent throughout the asylum process and under cross-examination and indeed in what he had said to the medical professionals. The points raised by the respondent were minor. His evidence had been consistent throughout. He had been involved in the Tamil movement and had given reasons why that was the case. Indeed, there was some evidence of Sinhala support for the Tamil cause and indeed evidence that those Sinhalese who supported the Tamils were more severely punished. The only inconsistency is relating to the appellant’s detention in 2015 as to whether or not the appellant was held at the airport. He had given a reason for this by stating that he was on a stop list. 21. She asked me to place no weight on the fact that the doctor had said that the appellant’s sister had attended with him. With regard to scarring she asked me to note that at no time had the respondent raised the issue of self-inflicted injury by proxy either in the refusal letter or at any other time. She stated that the reality was there was some inaccuracies in the general practitioner’s records, for example that she had referred to the appellant as being British but she had said that he had been assaulted in Sri Lanka. 22. She referred me to Dr Leggat’s report regarding lower back pain and asked me to make a distinction between lower back pain and upper back pain and stated in any event that pictures were provided at the substantive interview. She referred me to the report of Dr Cohen of the Medical Foundation which affirmed that the “burn lesions” were diagnostic of the cause of torture attributed and had stated that “by the definition of paragraph 187 of the Istanbul Protocol, that no other cause is possible”. This was a relatively rare finding and had been arrived at by an extremely experienced independent specialist medical expert from the Medical Foundation Medico-Legal Report Service. She also referred to the psychological report and the decision that the appellant required further counselling. She argued that the appellant was at risk of suicide and therefore would qualify under Article 3 of the ECHR. Discussion 23. While the reality is that it is likely to be rare that a Sinhalese would support the LTTE the appellant gave two reasons for why he carried out in transporting Tamils between Chilaw and Vavuniya. He stated that he had Tamil friends who had shown him videos of atrocities which had taken place. While Mr Kotas asked me to find that the appellant was inconsistent about what he had seen on the short videos the reality was that he saw more than one and therefore I do not consider that there is inconsistency between having seen instances of torture on video and the results of a bomb blast. Moreover, there was clearly a financial motive for this appellant whose income as a musician is unlikely to have been large and which was supplemented by his work as a tuk-tuk driver. I do not consider that there is anything of import in the apparent discrepancy between his saying that his father transported people by lorry on four occasions and also that he used his own tuk-tuk. It is clear that his father was involved in what might be considered to be a family money making scheme and I do not therefore place weight on any apparent discrepancy as to whether or not the lorry or the tuk-tuk was used on all occasions or, as is more likely, on most occasions but not on the last. Applying the low standard of proof, I accept the appellant’s evidence that for reasons both of sympathy – and he clearly had in mind the fact that the LTTE were themselves oppressing Tamils – that he should have transported Tamils not only out of sympathy but for financial reasons. I accept that having been detained that would have led to his detention and clearly if he were released after detention it would be likely that he would be asked to “sign on”. 24. Having arrived in Britain the appellant had leave to remain for two years and immediately, in 2010, obtained work. That in itself does not detract from his story of what had happened to him in Sri Lanka, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8. I do not place weight on the apparent discrepancy that he said that he was not working after 2012 despite the fact that he was apparently delivering pizza when he was trapped between two doors, a situation which could well have been traumatising for him particularly if he had been detained in the past. 25. The appellant says that his father was detained because of what he was doing and I consider that that is possible although I do not make any finding on whether or not the appellant’s father was killed while detained. 26. In all, having considered the evidence in detail I can only conclude on the low standard of proof the appellant’s story of events up to his coming to Britain are reasonably likely to have taken place. 27. I would add that I am not blind to discrepancies between what the appellant may have said at interview and what was recorded in the doctor’s notes but the reality is a doctor’s duty is not to take a witness statement but to consider medical matters and prescribe relevant remedies. 28. The appellant states that when he was returned to Sri Lanka in 2015 he was picked up by immigration and handed over to the CID when he was taken before a judge before being taken to prison. I do not consider that what he stated was inconsistent with the guidance in GJ given that he says that he was handed over by immigration to the CID and then taken to a judge before going to prison. In prison, he said he was tortured and asked to name people whose photographs he was shown before his release was secured by a Member of Parliament. He then escaped through the airport using a false passport with his own photograph. I consider that that is possible but it does lead to the issue of the scarring which he has on his back and which was shown to Dr Leggat. Dr Leggat was clearly of the view that the appellant was tortured in the way he claimed and that the scarring was diagnostic of that. She stated that the lesions she saw were in keeping with burn injuries sustained ten months previously - that is at the beginning of 2015 before the appellant returned. Her report is compliant with the Istanbul Protocol. She is clearly experienced and her credentials are endorsed by Dr Cohen. 29. Mr Kotas referred me to the general practitioner’s notes, pointing out that when the appellant saw his general practitioner on his return in April and May 2015 no mentioned was made of scarring. However, it is the case that when the appellant was seen in May 2015 with the problem of “back pain” the doctor did state “assault in Sri Lanka February?” and stated that there was tenderness to the bone. On 15 June 2016 the notes referred to, on examination “scars on back from where being burned.”. It is of note that that entry does not state “new scars” and although the notes refer to the appellant having a “usual GP”, Dr Sun, I consider that had “new” scars been found on that occasion that would have been indicated. I therefore do not place weight on the fact that scars were not mentioned when the appellant was first examined by his GP and indeed I cannot be certain that the doctor looked at his upper back as it was lower back pain for which he went to see the doctor. I would add that the reality is when interviewed on 30 July 2015 the appellant did state that he had been tortured but it is of note that there were no follow up questions asked. It would have surely been appropriate for the interviewer to have asked how he was tortured or asked to see the scars. While the writer of the refusal letter did have photographs of the scars before him, they were only considered in the light of the guidance in Tanveer Ahmed which quite clearly from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in KV was not appropriate. Again, following that judgment and there being no alternative explanation put forward by the respondent I can only find that the appellant’s scars were obtained in the way he states - that is that he was tortured in Sri Lanka in 2015. 30. Mr Kotas asked me to conclude that, even taking the appellant’s claim at its highest he would not be in danger of persecution on return now following the guidance in GJ. 31. I follow the judgment in ME (Sri Lanka) and note that of course the guidance in GJ is not determinative. There is also in the background documentation considerable evidence that there is still ongoing ill-treatment of those who are thought to be inimical to the Sri Lankan state. Moreover, I am conscious of the provisions of paragraph 339 of the Rules and that past persecution can be determinative of future persecution. While I accept Mr Kotas’ argument that there is no arrest warrant outstanding for the appellant on return and no warrant for his arrest I consider that given what has happened in the past there must be a serious possibility that he would be on a stop list and therefore detained, and coming from Britain with his history and indeed what he asserts was said to the judge and what was given as a reason for his continued detention - that he was coming from Britain and might have been involved in diaspora activities and be a supporter of the LTTE - and further given that there is some evidence that Sinhalese who supported the LTTE are treated particularly harshly, I consider that on the low standard of proof there is a real risk that the appellant would face persecution on return. I therefore, having set aside the decision of the First-tier Judge, allow this appeal on asylum and human rights grounds. Notice of Decision This appeal is allowed on asylum grounds and further on human rights grounds (Article 3). Direction Regarding Anonymity – Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of their family. This direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. Signed:  Date: 5 May 2019 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy Annex. 1. The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Carroll, who in a determination promulgated on 25 October 2018 allowed the appeal of TW against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to grant asylum. 2. Although the Secretary of State is the appellant before me I will for ease of reference refer to him as the respondent as he was the respondent in the First-tier. Similarly I will refer to TW as the appellant as he was the appellant in the First-tier. 3. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 23 June 1983. He initially came to Britain as a student in June 2010 but his leave to remain in that capacity was curtailed in May 2012. He then applied for a further leave to remain as a student. That application was refused in January 2015. 4. The following month the appellant left Britain intending to travel to Canada via Martinique. In Martinique he was detained by the French Authorities and found to be in possession of a forged passport. After being detained for three days he was then deported to Sri Lanka. 5. He alleges that on 21 February 2015, on his return to Sri Lanka, he was detained and imprisoned until 4 March 2015 and while in prison that he was beaten and tortured. He was shown photographs and asked if he knew who the people photographed were. His mother spoke to a Member of Parliament and secured his release. The appellant then left Sri Lanka. 6. The appellant’s claim was that, although he was Sinhalese he and his father had helped transport LTTE members from Vavuniya to Colombo between 2007 and 2010. He said that in March 2009 he had been stopped in a random check when it was found that he was wanted by the TID. He was detained by the police before being taken to the Boosa Camp in Galle where he was kept until November that year being tortured but not questioned. His brother paid a bribe for him to be released and after release he had been told to report in Colombo. He had left Colombo in August 2010 to come to Britain. 7. The judge in paragraphs 2 to 8 set out the appellant’s immigration and procedural history but made no mention of his being detained in Sri Lanka in 2015. He did however state that he adopted paragraphs 3 to 13 of the reasons for refusal which referred to the appellant being detained in March 2010 and in 2015. 8. The judge noted medical evidence which included a report from Dr Virginia Leggatt. He quoted from that report and in particular a section heading “interpretation of physical evidence” which referred to lesions which were caused by burns to the appellant’s back sustained while he was imprisoned in March 2015. She said that she had examined him in January 2016 - months later - and that the lesions were in keeping with burn injuries sustained ten months before. 9. The judge also referred to a letter from Dr Cohen of the Medical Foundation who referred to Dr Leggatt’s report saying that her finding that the burn lesions were diagnostic of torture was a relatively rare finding but had been arrived at by an extremely experienced independent specialist medical expert and he went on to further comment that Dr Leggatt had said that the appellant had not exaggerated or embellished his psychological evidence which might be expected in a person fabricating an account. The judge also considered a psychiatric report prepared by Dr S Dhumad who concluded that the appellant’s presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of moderate depressive episode and that his symptoms met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. 10. The judge referred to the determination of the Tribunal in GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] and to the various relevant factors set out therein. 11. In paragraphs 23 onwards the judge set out his assessment of the appellant’s case. He noted that the appellant’s involvement with the LTTE was limited to the years 2007 to 2009 and that he did not claim to be subject to any arrest warrant nor did he claim to have taken part in any Tamil activist activities whilst in the UK. He noted that the appellant claimed to have been required to report after his second detention and that his claim that he would be of interest to the Sri Lankan Authorities “arises out of his claim that he has been twice detained and tortured”. 12. The judge went on to say that aspects of the appellant’s account “are insufficiently supported by the evidence” referring to the appellant’s claim that his father was arrested, detained and killed. The judge stated that the only document before him relating to the appellant’s father’s death indicated that the death, as recorded, was due to a train accident. 13. The judge then went on to say:- “25. Looked at overall, however, the appellant has given a credible and consistent account throughout the asylum process and throughout his engagement with the medical professionals. Dr Leggatt’s report is exceptionally careful and detailed and as I have noted above was not before the respondent at the time of the decision under appeal. 26. I am satisfied to the required standard that the appellant is credible as to the core of his account to have been detained and tortured twice by the Sri Lankan Authorities. He has not sought to embellish his account by claiming to have had any role in post-conflict Tamil separatism during his time in the United Kingdom but the evidence shows that he is highly likely, if returned, to be the subject of adverse interest to the Sri Lankan Authorities. It was accepted in GJ and Others that internal relocation is not possible for those who are considered to be of adverse interest to the Authorities.” 14. The judge therefore allowed the appeal. 15. The Secretary of State appealed the decision of the judge in the First-tier stating that the judge having found that the appellant did not claim to be subject to any arrest warrant and did not claim to have taken part in any Tamil activist activities in Britain had failed to correctly apply the risk attack categories in GJ and Others when finding that the appellant was at risk on return, particularly given the factual findings that the appellant had ceased activity with the LTTE in 2009, there was no outstanding arrest warrant against him and he was not involved in any diaspora activities. Moreover the determination in GJ had stated that in post-conflict Sri Lanka an individual’s past history will be relevant only to the extent that was perceived by the Sri Lankan Authorities as indicating a present risk to the unitary Sri Lankan state or Sri Lankan Government. 16. It was stated that the judge had failed to adhere to the findings/risk categories in the extant country guidance case by allowing the appeal on the basis of the appellant’s past history in Sri Lanka, rather than the risk factors outlined in GJ and Others. 17. Permission to appeal was granted on that basis. 18. At the hearing of the appeal before me Ms Willocks-Briscoe stated that the judge had accepted that the appellant had been detained and tortured only twice and therefore the remainder of what he had said should be taken as not being accepted by the judge. It was not clear on what basis the judge had found that the appellant would be at risk on return. The judge had himself pointed out there was no extant arrest warrant nor was it suggested there was any ongoing investigation with regards to the appellant. The findings did not say that he was required to report but only that he had been detained and tortured. Therefore the appellant did not fall into any of the relevant risk categories. 19. Ms Jegarajah, in reply, stated that the grounds of the appeal were misconceived. The judge had found it credible that the appellant had been detained on two occasions. She referred to evidence of the appellant’s mental health difficulties and the fact that there was evidence that he had been tortured. The judge had incorporated the Secretary of State’s factual summary and she stated that there was evidence from the appellant’s mother that CID officers had visited her house after the appellant had been released who had said that he had escaped and asked that he be produced. She stated the judge was not required to give much by way of reasoning. The interview was very detailed and it was clear that the judge accepted what the appellant had said. The appellant had indicated at interview that he believed that the Authorities thought that he had been helping the LTTE in Britain. 20. She referred to the judgement in ME (Sri Lanka) [2018] EWCA Civ 1486 asserting that it was evident that any detention was based on sophisticated intelligence and that the appellant would still be of interest in return. 21. In reply Ms Willocks-Briscoe said that the reality was that the judge had not made findings nor any attempt to analyse the appellant’s account. It was not clear how he came to his conclusions. Discussion. 22. I consider that there are material errors of law in the determination. The reality is that it was incumbent upon the judge to have engaged with the case before him. 23. It is of note that the judge did not engage with the terms of the Reasons for Refusal Letter which found that the appellant’s claim to have helped the LTTE was not credible and had noted that by his own admission the appellant had not attended any LTTE events or demonstrations or been politically active in Sri Lanka and it was therefore considered that he did not have a significant role or profile in relation to post-Tamil separatism and therefore his profile did not meet the relevant category set out in GJ. Moreover the appellant was not a journalist or human rights activist, had not given evidence to the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Committee and there was nothing to indicate that his name was on a computerised stop list accessible at the airport, comprising a list of those against whom there was an extant court order or arrest warrant. 24. The letter pointed out that he had left Sri Lanka on his own passport in August 2010 and had only stated “I think so” when asked if the Authorities were still looking for him and had not accepted that he was of current interest to the Sri Lankan Authorities. 25. The Reasons for Refusal Letter contained a section dealing with the appellant’s claimed arrest and detention in February 2015 on the basis that it was not accepted that the appellant had helped the LTTE before leaving in March 2010. Reference was made to the treatment of deportees from Britain on return to Sri Lanka. It was accepted that whilst the appellant might have been questioned because he had been deported from Martinique, that would have been in order to determine if he had any outstanding warrants or criminal offences. Clearly the appellant had had none. It was also evident that returnees were held for no more than seven hours and no one had ever been arrested or detained on arrival in Sri Lanka and the letter asserted therefore that it was inconsistent that the appellant would have been arrested on return. It was stated that the photographs did not support his claimed treatment in detention. It was also pointed out that the appellant had attempted to enter Britain under a false identity in May 2015 which was a factor that damaged his credibility. 26. The judge simply did not engage with the reasons given by the Secretary of State for refusing the application nor does he give reasons for accepting what the appellant said and why he considered that the respondent was wrong to conclude that the appellant was not credible. He merely states that he accepts the appellant’s evidence. 27. It was incumbent upon him to make findings of fact in the context of the background evidence including that set out in relevant country guidance, give reasons for his findings and then to consider the claim in the context of the categories set out in country guidance. 28. Clearly the judge did not do this and I consider that that is an error of law and accordingly I set aside his determination. Ms Jegarajah asserted that the grounds of appeal were misconceived in that they did not assert that the judge had made findings which were not open to him or were in any way perverse but merely referred to the fact that the judge did not apply the criteria set out in GJ and furthermore that that country guidance case related to Tamils and not to Sinhalese such as the appellant who assisted Tamils and was therefore irrelevant. While I consider that the grounds of appeal could more clearly have asserted that the judge erred by not giving reasons for his findings and conclusion, they concentrated on the fact that the judge had not applied the relevant country guidance in GJ and I consider that the grounds, by focusing on the fact that the judge did not apply that country guidance, did clearly point to the error of law in the determination in that that CG determination which focusing on claims made by Tamils can clearly be applied to any who assert that they would be persecuted because of their support of the Tamil cause. By not considering the claim within the context set out in GJ when making his credibility findings the judge erred in law. 29. It is therefore appropriate that I set aside the determination of the first-tier judge. Notice of Decision The judgment of the First-tier Judge is set aside. Directions Given that this appeal has already been remitted to the First-tier on two occasions the appeal will remain in the Upper Tribunal for a full hearing on all issues. The time estimate, four hours. Sinhalese interpreter. The appellant will serve a further bundle of documents duly paginated containing the appellant’s statements, the medical reports, relevant case law and background information.",2019-05-14

DECISION AND REASONS INTRODUCTION On 6 February 2000 the appellants and others took control of an Ariana Afghan Airlines Boeing 727 during an internal flight from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan, their country of nationality. The plane flew to Tashkent where it refueled and then to Kazakhstan for a minor repair, before reaching Moscow. It is believed that some passengers were released at a point prior to the aircraft reaching Moscow where a further number were released. The plane continued to the United Kingdom where it landed in the early hours on the following day. The appellants were accompanied by several of their family members. The complement of those on board by the time the plane landed in Stansted included the flight crew, some 50 passengers being the appellants and their family members and about 100 other passengers. A handful of those passengers were released after arrival. Some of the flight crew escaped but otherwise the appellants, their family members and the other passengers remained on board for upwards of 70 hours until the hijackers surrendered to the UK authorities on 10 February when they claimed asylum. Prior to a decision on their asylum claims, charges were laid against the appellants who were remanded to HMP Belmarsh Prison. They were subsequently released on bail by the Crown Court and from administrative detention by the immigration authorities under the Immigration Act 1971. Their appeals are before us in order to decide whether the First-tier Tribunal (the 2015 Panel) erred in law in their decision dated 7 July 2015 that the appellants are excluded from the Refugee Convention under Article 1F(b). Any reference to ‘the appellants’ is to all. Reference to ‘the eight appellants’ does not include KU. We have both contributed in equal part to this decision. THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS The first criminal trial ended inconclusively on 18 April 2001 after the jury could not agree verdicts. A second trial presided over by Sir Edwin Jowitt commenced in late 2001 when three of the appellants gave evidence. On 6 December 2001 the appellants, apart from KU, were convicted of hijacking. KU was unfit to stand trial and was formerly acquitted of all charges on 26 June 2003 upon the Crown electing to offer no evidence against him unconditionally. The sentences imposed by Sir Edwin on 18 January 2002 were 60 months’ imprisonment for [AAS] and [MNS] (who are brothers) with an order that they should serve half their sentences in custody before being eligible for parole. The remainder of the eight appellants were sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment on the basis that they would be released on licence after serving half their sentences. The eight appellants had been on bail but returned to custody after their conviction. On 22 May 2003 the Court of Appeal quashed all of the convictions on the basis of a “crucial misdirection” given by the trial judge as to their defence of duress. By this time six of the eight appellants had already been released from custody on licence and as a result of the court’s decision the remaining two brothers were released having served respectively 22 months and 24 months of their 60 months sentences. The Court of Appeal did not direct a retrial. The Crown did not seek a retrial after unsuccessfully applying for permission to appeal the decision. HISTORY OF THE PROTECTION APPEALS On 25 June 2003 the eight appellants were refused asylum and leave to enter the United Kingdom. Their appeals were heard by a panel of immigration adjudicators (the 2004 Panel) between 26 April and 10 May 2004. In a lengthy and detailed decision dated 3 June 2004, the appeals of the eight appellants together with an additional party to the hijacking, DD, who had subsequently absconded, were dismissed on asylum grounds. Each of the appeals however were allowed on human rights grounds on the basis that their return to Afghanistan would be in breach of Article 3. The 2004 Panel heard evidence from the eight appellants. Their claims had been based on their involvement in a group called the Young Intellectuals of Afghanistan (YIA), an organisation whose leaders all had direct or indirect connections with the previous communist regime. The appellants’ fears were based on hostility from the Taliban Government who had taken control of Kabul in 1996 and extended their control over most of the country. The YIA had been founded by the brothers [S] in 1997. Members of the group had been arrested by the Taliban in January 2000 and as a result, the group’s security had been compromised. This led to the decision by the appellants to escape from Afghanistan by hijacking the aircraft on 6 February. The issue of exclusion under Article 1F(b) had been raised by the Secretary of State late in the day. The 2004 Panel conclusions on this aspect were in terms that:- There was no doubt in the appellants’ minds that hijacking by its very nature was serious. The panel agreed with the submissions by the Secretary of State that the hijacking was not a political crime. The appellants could have attempted an alternative means of escape to a neighbouring country and could have chosen to travel to Pakistan. That there were no serious grounds for concluding that the appellants were placed in such a position that they were compelled to carry out the hijacking or that they were under such pressure as to justify the hijacking. Having regard to the narrow ambit of the issue we are required to decide, there is no need to dwell on why the eight appellants were successful on Article 3 grounds except to observe that it was essentially because the 2004 Panel found there was a real risk they would be targeted for assassination by the Taliban who had condemned them to death in absentia. The 2004 Panel considered that the eight appellants could be at risk because of their particularly high profile and their unique position as the main actors in the hijacking. The eight appellants did not appeal the exclusion decision. The Secretary of State however applied for permission to appeal the decision on Article 3 grounds. Permission was refused by the Deputy President of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal who introduced his analysis of each of the grounds with the following remarks:- “The determination appears to me to be a careful and proper examination of all the evidence in its proper context. It could not be said that the evidence compelled the findings: but looking at them generally and in the light of the grounds I can see no error of law. The adjudicators were entitled to reach the findings they did, and in general the grounds amount only to differences of opinion arising out of preferences of emphasis.” The Secretary of State did not grant the eight appellants leave to remain despite their success under Article 3. Following successful proceedings by way of judicial review, each was granted discretionary leave to remain in the United Kingdom for a period of six months on 19 May 2006. They applied on 15 November 2006 for further leave to remain including the basis that they were refugees and entitled to protection under the Refugee Convention. A decision on KU’s application (made six years previously with the eight appellants) was not given until 12 October 2009. In essence, the Secretary of State reviewed the decision on 18 November 2009 and decided to exclude KU from the Refugee Convention by a supplementary decision letter dated 18 January 2012. The remaining eight appellants’ applications were refused by the Secretary of State on dates between 15 September 2009 and 25 October 2011. The First-tier Tribunal heard their appeals in 2009; they were unsuccessful and were granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal who in 2010 set aside the decision after concluding the First tier had erred in law. The case was remitted to the First tier Tribunal who decided the appeals in three stages. The first hearing was to decide the issue whether the appellants would be at risk of persecution or subject to serious harm if returned to Afghanistan. In a decision dated 15 October 2013 a panel of First-tier Tribunal judges (DJ FtTJs Campbell and Peart) concluded that all the appellants had demonstrated that their removal would put them at risk of persecution and of ill-treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention. A second hearing was by what we have referred to as the 2015 Panel in order to decide whether the appellants were properly to be excluded from the Refugee Convention under Article 1F(b). In a decision dated 7 July 2015 the same panel concluded that the appellants including KU were excluded under Article 1F(b). Our task is to decide whether this panel erred in law. The third hearing was to decide whether the co-appellants (the family members) of the appellants were at real risk of being persecuted and thus entitled to refugee status. A single judge (DJ FtTJ Campbell) decided that they were for reasons given in his decision dated 20 December 2017. Each of the appellants sought permission to appeal the decision of the 2015 Panel to the Upper Tribunal. Upper Tribunal Judge Martin granted permission to appeal in a decision dated 18 January 2018. The President of the Upper Tribunal and UTJ Dawson decided on 2 November 2018 that the proper construction of the grant of permission by UTJ Martin was entirely unrestricted, see Safi and others (permission to appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 388. THE GROUNDS OF CHALLENGE. KU is separately represented and we shall refer to his grounds after setting out those relied on by the first eight appellants which are as follows:- Ground 1 Having been acquitted of committing the asserted crime of hijacking the aircraft, it is argued that Article 1F(b) is manifestly inapplicable to the appellants. It is contended that the 2015 Panel erred by concentrating exclusively on the differing standards of proof in rejecting the appellants’ submission based on the acquittal and inapplicability and by failing to consider adequately or at all the principal basis for applying exclusion under Article 1F(b) in the first place. It is argued that the ground raises an important point of principle that has not been considered or tested in the higher courts. Ground 2 In rejecting the appellants’ submission that there were no serious reasons for considering the offence to have been committed, the 2015 Panel had misdirected itself in law by applying too high a standard to the duress test for the purposes of determining whether there were serious reasons for considering the appellants had committed a crime with the necessary mens rea by applying the test for duress under international criminal law as set down in MT (Article 1F(a) – aiding and abetting) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 00015 (IAC). Further, and/or in the alternative, the 2015 Panel had misdirected itself in law by erroneously conflating the issue of “whether there was or may have been, as a matter of fact and as found to be the case by the 2004 Panel, an alternative to the hijack of the aeroplane as a means for the appellants to escape from the Taliban … and the correct legal question of whether the appellants could reasonably have believed that their only safe means of escape was to do as they did”. Ground 3 With reference to the appellants’ political opposition to the Taliban controlled government, their hijacking of the aircraft fitted clearly within the meaning of a political crime as per Lord Diplock’s definition in R v Governor Pentonville, exparte Cheng [1973] AC 931 that was citied with approval by the House of Lords in T v Immigration Officer [1996] AC 742 when directly addressing Article 1F(b). But for the 2015 Panel’s error over the proper approach to duress, the Panel would and should have concluded the appellants’ case fell squarely within “a political crime” as per the position of the Polish seaman in R v Governor of Brixton ex parte Kolczynski & Others [1955] 1QB 540. Ground 4 The appellants reserved their position on their submission that any criminal liability was expiated and inapt to exclude the appellants in the light of the judgment in AH (Algeria) v SSHD (No. 2) [2015] EWCA Civ 1003. At the hearing we granted the appellants permission to amend their grounds. They applied to do so after Mr Payne argued that they had not challenged the 2015 Panel’s decision over the second limb to the test of whether a crime was political by reference to its remoteness. The amendment was in the following terms (in relation to ground 3):- “In particular with reference to paragraph 47 in the determination it is submitted that the [2015 Panel] erred in law by finding that [a] there was insufficient political motive and [b] for finding that any actions taken brought them outside a political crime by reference to remoteness and proportionality.” Mr Jacobs on behalf of KU adopted and sought the same amendment to his grounds which we refer to below. Mr Payne opposed the application with reference to its timing (on day 3) and the significant prejudice to the Secretary of State as it was not well articulated with reference to the second limb and still unclear. In deciding to permit the amendment we observed the length of time the case had been running and that it was one in which the representatives had been involved for at least a decade. They were very familiar with the facts and the legal issues. We had heard argument on the previous day in relation to the issue of remoteness and there had been no intervention at that stage on the basis that it was not encompassed within ground 3. Accordingly, Mr Payne was aware of the extent of the appellants’ challenge before he came to make his own submissions towards the end of day 2. The ground as initially pleaded brought into scope the correctness of the application of the test by the 2015 Panel. The amended grounds were in general terms but we were satisfied that, when considered in the light of the arguments raised on day 2, the respondent knew well the case the appellants had advanced. It was open to Mr Payne to launch an attack on the amended grounds reflecting the concerns expressed in this opposition, but they were not a reason not to grant. It was in the interests of justice and having regard to the overriding objective of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 that we considered it appropriate to accede to the application. In an exchange that followed, Mr Jorro, on behalf of all the appellants, confirmed that they were not challenging the findings of the 2004 Panel and there was no need for further submissions based on the amended grounds. Mr Payne was content to make his submissions on the amended grounds at the conclusion of his arguments which had opened with his concerns that the remoteness aspect had not been a ground of challenge on which permission had been granted. KU KU adopted and relied on the grounds of challenge set out above and specifically adds and develops the following points:- Ground 1 The 2015 Panel erred in failing to apply a purposive approach to the determination of the exclusion issue and failed to consider the position of the UNHCR set out in its note on the exclusion clauses dated 30 May 1997. Having been formally acquitted of all criminal charges relating to the hijacking KU did not meet the rational of exclusion in that he is not a criminal who presents a danger to the security of the UK and therefore does not abuse the integrity of the concept of asylum through recognition as a refugee. In addition, the 2015 Panel erred in applying the obiter comments of Blake J in AH. The UNHCR view that the exclusion clauses must be restrictively interpreted and cautiously applied were endorsed by the Supreme Court in Al-Sirri. Ground 2 Whilst the medical expert found that KU was aware of his involvement in the hijacking, his finding of a very severe duress amounted to a material issue which the 2015 Panel failed to consider properly or at all. The accepted medical evidence was that KU had been severely tortured by the Taliban and suffered from severe trauma in that he saw no option other than going along with the hijacking plan in order to save his life. The 2015 Panel therefore erred when finding that KU was not acting under duress and failed to apply the correct test and failed to address the medical evidence on this aspect. Ground 3 The 2015 Panel made no finding whether KU’s involvement in the hijacking arose a from political persecution and therefore outside the scope of Article 1F(b). The hijack was clearly political as opposed to criminal for the purposes of that provision. The hijack was the means by which KU fled persecution arising from his political activity with the YIA. There was no other motivation. Fleeing from persecution amounts to a political purpose under Article 1F(b). Ground 4 As with the other appellants, KU reserves his position on the issue of expiation in the light of AH (Algeria). Ground 5 The 2015 Panel erred in failing to apply a discretion in KU’s case by reference to a passage from The Refugee in International Law (Third Edition) by Professor Goodwin-Gill and which was accompanied by an extract from page 176. Finally, the 2015 Panel had erred in failing to reach fact specific findings in relation to KU whose appeal had come before them for the first time and in respect of whom there were compelling reasons for applying the approach brought forward by Professor Goodwin-Gill. MATTERS ARISING AT THE HEARING The hearing took place over three days and we are grateful to the parties for their written submissions and the care with which they advanced their respective cases. In response to our query during Mr Seddon’s submissions on the first ground in which he referred to autrefois acquit being a bar to any further prosecution we were provided in due course with a statement from Mark Summers QC who had represented the appellants at the time. Our enquiry had come about as the result of an assertion by the appellants’ solicitor to the 2004 Panel that no retrial was pursued by the Crown because the appellants had largely served their sentences. Neither the 2004 nor the 2015 Panels were given evidence on the matter and accordingly any new evidence will only be relevant should we decide to set aside the decision of the 2015 Panel. Similarly, we hold in abeyance the application under r.15(2A) by the appellants to adduce new evidence. We were provided with versions of Home Office guidance: Exclusion (Article 1F) and Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention and the European Asylum Support Office Judicial Analysis: Exclusion: Articles 12 and 17. No reliance was placed on this material. LEGAL FRAMEWORK Article 1F of the Refugee Convention provides: ‘F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.’ Article 12 of the Qualification Directive 2004 provides under the heading exclusion: ‘1. A third country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee, if: he or she falls within the scope of Article 1 D of the Geneva Convention, relating to protection or assistance from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitely settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, these persons shall ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of this Directive; he or she is recognised by the competent authorities of the country in which he or she has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country; or rights and obligations equivalent to those. 2. A third country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee where there are serious reasons for considering that: (a) he or she has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; (b) he or she has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his or her admission as a refugee; which means the time of issuing a residence permit based on the granting of refugee status; particularly cruel actions, even if committed with an allegedly political objective, may be classified as serious non-political crimes; (c) he or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations as set out in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. Paragraph 2 applies to persons who instigate or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts mentioned therein.’ The Refugee or Person in Need of International Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006 provide in paragraph 7 under the heading exclusion: ‘7. (1) A person is not a refugee, if he falls within the scope of Article 1 D, 1E or 1F of the Geneva Convention. (2) In the construction and application of Article 1F(b) of the Geneva Convention: (a) the reference to serious non-political crime includes a particularly cruel action, even if it is committed with an allegedly political objective; (b) the reference to the crime being committed outside the country of refuge prior to his admission as a refugee shall be taken to mean the time up to and including the day on which a residence permit is issued. (3) Article 1F(a) and (b) of the Geneva Convention shall apply to a person who instigates or otherwise participates in the commission of the crimes or acts specified in those provisions.’ THE 2015 PANEL’S SURVEY OF THE FINDINGS BY THE 2004 PANEL The 2015 Panel took the findings of fact by the 2004 Panel as their starting point noting the agreement of the parties that there was no need to displace those findings. That remains the case today. Although KU was not a party to those proceedings, the 2015 Panel noted the parties’ agreement that he was in a similar position to the other appellants with regard to exclusion as he was in relation to the assessment of risk on return. Mr Jacobs’s position is recorded at [4] of the 2015 Panel’s decision as follows:- “Mr Jacobs submitted on [KU’s] behalf that although he was involved in a hijack in the sense that he boarded the plane and was aware of the intentions of the hijackers, he played a minimal role due to trauma related ill-health on the flight. In his particular case, exclusion under 1F(b) was not justified.” None of the appellants gave evidence before the 2015 Panel. With the exception of KU, all gave evidence in 2004. The 2015 Panel was not persuaded to have any regard to the findings including the adverse credibility findings by the Tribunal in 2009. As we have observed above, the decision of 2004 Panel is a lengthy and very detailed one. The 2015 Panel surveyed the findings in relation to exclusion in various passages as follows:- “17. … The 2004 Panel found that the appellants and their family members could have attempted an alternative means of escape to a neighbouring country. The 2004 Panel made a clear finding that there was not such an immediacy of danger of arrest or lack of opportunity to move away from the Kabul area such that the appellants would have been left with no alternative to the hijack. They found that the appellants could have chosen to travel to Pakistan and if they had travelled there, it was most unlikely that they would have experienced any particular difficulties moving on from there to another destination. The further they travelled away from Afghanistan and the Peshawar area, the less likely they would have been to fall into danger. The appellants could have remained elsewhere in Pakistan or, having travelled from there, could have claimed asylum in another country. 18. … There is nothing to displace the clear findings of fact made by the 2004 Panel that there was no such immediacy of danger of arrest, or lack of opportunity to move away from Kabul. We have taken into account the 2004 Panel’s findings that the appellants had ample access to finance and contacts with expertise, to assist in the planning and implementation of the hijack. They had access to military skills and weapons. There was a prolonged period of preparation for the hijack which involved the collection of weapons from Pakistan and the gathering of family members in Kabul, ready for the flight. … … 26. … The Panel found that it was evident that hijacking poses a grave threat to the life and safety of innocent passengers and crew and it is for that reason that there is such opprobrium attached to acts of hijacking. The Panel found that hijacking is, by its very nature, serious and, overall, that a serious crime was committed. … 28. … Important factors leading us to conclude that the crime was a serious one are the extent of the prior planning, involving as it did trips to Pakistan to purchase weapons, the threats and violence towards the crew and the passengers and the fact that there was clearly more than one manifestation of the armed seizure and control of the aircraft, the journey from Kabul to London consisting as it did of more than one landing and take-off. There was significant physical, psychological and emotional harm to others on the aeroplane and, as we make clear below, we agree with the 2004 Panel’s conclusion that the hijacking was not a last and unavoidable recourse to escape danger. … 30. … The individual accounts which emerged in evidence [in 2004] reveal the extent of the planning of the hijack and two of the appellants travelled to Pakistan to purchase weapons. In summary, the 2004 Panel found that the appellants had alternative means available to them other than hijacking the Ariana aircraft and that travel to Pakistan (including to Peshawar) to escape Afghanistan was possible, although not free from risk … … 39. The 2004 Panel found as a fact that the appellants had time to consider their options. Between them, they had skills in military and commando training, military intelligence, the use of weapons, communications surveillance and undercover surveillance (paragraph 71 of the determination). They were able to purchase guns and grenades in advance of the hijack. The Panel found that there was a large measure of support for the view that the funds and weapons available to the appellants could have been used to effect escape from Afghanistan by means other than hijacking a plane. In relation to one appellant, the Panel found that if the Taliban were really looking to arrest him, it would have been more dangerous to go to the airport at Kabul rather than slip across the border into Pakistan. 40. … Having left Afghanistan, the plane landed in Tashkent and then again in Moscow. On each occasion, it was hijacked again to the next destination and although there was a possibility of surrendering to the authorities on each landing, the appellants chose not to do so (paragraph 84 of the 2004 Panel’s determination). In considering whether a viable alternative to hijacking existed the Panel took into account the extensive business links outside Afghanistan that a number of the appellants had in the period before the hijack. The Panel found that the appellants were resourceful with substantial links to Pakistan, access to large sums of money, the wherewithal to purchase weapons and the ability to bribe at least one higher ranking official. 41. The 2004 Panel accepted that the appellants would have faced challenges in travelling to a neighbouring country and that there was a danger that they would have been found and thereafter arrested. Accepting that the Taliban or at least those members to whom the arrest warrant had been distributed would have been aware that some of the appellants were “wanted”, the 2004 Panel rejected the contention that there was effectively a ring round Kabul so that there was no alternative to leaving by means of a hijack. Many of the appellants, in giving evidence showed that they were able to move around Afghanistan at a time when they were wanted by the authorities and therefore in danger. The 2004 Panel noted that the borders of Afghanistan were porous and found that the appellants could have attempted an alternative means of escape to a neighbouring country. There were routes into Pakistan, notwithstanding a strong Taliban and radical Islamic movement presence there. If the appellants crossed the border, it was most unlikely that they would have experienced any further difficulties moving on, further away from Afghanistan and the Peshawar area. They could have remained in Pakistan or travelled onto another country to claim asylum and they could have claimed asylum in Tashkent or in Moscow.” THE 2015 PANEL SYNOPSIS OF THE SENTENCING REMARKS BY SIR EDWIN JOWITT Specifically in respect of Sir Edwin Jowitt’s sentencing remarks, the 2015 Panel observed at [35] and [36]:- “35. … Sir Edwin Jowitt’s sentencing remarks were, of course made entirely in the context of the criminal trial, and included a clear finding that he had not heard the whole truth about the decision to hijack from the three defendants who gave evidence and those defendants lied in parts of their evidence. Importantly, Sir Edwin Jowitt sentenced on the basis that the planning of the hijack took at least some days. This is consistent with the 2004 Panel’s assessment, regarding the extent of the prior planning and the sophistication of the arrangements put in place before the hijack began. 36. Sir Edwin Jowitt sentenced on the basis that it had not been proved that the hijack was criminal from the outset. He was sure that it became criminal at the latest from the time the aircraft took off from Moscow, as those who wished to leave were not given the opportunity to do so. He accepted that there was a risk of the identities of the defendants becoming known to the Taliban, as members of the YIA with a further risk of arrest and torture or worse. As Mr Payne submitted, Sir Edwin Jowitt was clear that the hijack caused great fear and anxiety to those who shared no cause with the hijackers and their family members. There were about 100 passengers and the flight crew in this category. They were all taken from Moscow onto Stansted and kept for more than 70 hours save for a handful released on arrival in the United Kingdom. This displayed a callous disregard for the interests, anxieties and fears for the passengers and crew. The hijackers patrolled the isle of the aircraft armed with handguns and knives. Sir Edwin Jowitt accepted the [S] brothers wished to make a political point about conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan but found that this did not excuse the continuing detention of the passengers, who had nothing to do with the YIA and their families. He found that the threats made to those on board must have been terrifying to a significant number of the passengers although he accepted that the hijackers had no wish or intention to harm them. The flight crew escaped at some point and this resulted in violence inflicted by the hijackers on the stewards.” 2015 PANEL FINDINGS IN RELATION TO KU The 2015 Panel explained how it took into account the medical evidence in particular that of Dr Silver who provided reports in 2001 and 2010 and who also reviewed KU’s circumstances in 2002. The Panel observed at [50] and [51]:- “50. … The conclusion he reached in the most recent report is that [KU] was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of hijacking, which caused severe distress, incapacity and disability. On the other hand, Dr Silver did not believe that the psychiatric disorder itself, post-traumatic stress disorder affected [KU’s] culpability and he did not believe that [KU] was acting in effect due to automatism. Although too unwell to participate to the extent that his colleagues were able to, [KU] knew what he was doing when he boarded the aeroplane in order to hijack it. 51. We find that the evidence shows that [KU] was able to play a substantial role of the planning and organisation of the hijack including taking part in collection of weapons from Pakistan. As Mr Payne submitted [KU] was able to leave Afghanistan for this purpose and return, at a time when he was by his own account taking medicines to control his symptoms.” DID THE 2015 PANEL ERR IN LAW? The parties relied extensively on case law in support of their submissions as to the correct approach in relation to each of the issues raised in each ground. Our task at this stage is to decide whether the decision of the 2015 Panel is legally sustainable by reference to the grounds of challenge set out above and which, in summary, are the effect of the acquittal for the appellants (including KU), on whether there are serious reasons for considering the appellants committed a serious non-political crime, the issue of duress and finally (since we are bound to dismiss the appeals on the issue of expiation) on whether the hijacking was a non-political crime. We need in addition to specifically consider the discretion point discreetly raised for KU. There is unsurprisingly no dispute as to the 2015 Panel’s conclusion that the hijacking was serious. We begin our analysis of each of the grounds with a summary of the authorities followed by a summary of the submissions before reaching our conclusions. Some of the authorities overlap the grounds particularly those where the courts considered the overall purpose of 1F(b). To the extent that KU warrants different treatment we have done so. THE EFFECT OF THE ACQUITTAL ON ARTICLE 1F(b). The starting point is what is understood by Article 1F(b). The interpretation of international treaties is governed by Art 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This requires good faith interpretation in accordance with the “ordinary meaning” of a treaties' terms, the context, and the object and its purpose as the starting point. In R v Asfaw (Appellant) [2008] UKHL 31, a case concerning a decision to prosecute an individual with an offence that was not included in s.31(3) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, but which clearly and unambiguously fell into the ambit of Article 31 of the Refugee Convention (dealing with the prohibition of penalties for illegal entry by refugees), the House of Lords, adopted a construction of Article 31 that was consistent with the humanitarian purpose of the Refugee Convention (paras 26). This purposive construction has been recently re-articulated in F v M [2017] EWHC 949 (Fam), at para 32. Al-Sirri (FC) and DD (Afghanistan) (FC) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2012] UKSC 54 concerned an Egyptian whom the SSHD excluded from the Refugee Convention under 1F(c). The exclusion was based on several matters, including his alleged participation in a conspiracy to murder a military and political leader, although the charges in respect of which he had been indicted in the UK were dismissed by the Crown Court on the ground that the evidence would be insufficient for a jury to properly convict. The Supreme Court accepted that 1F(c) should be interpreted restrictively and applied with caution (at [16] & [75]). The Court also held that the guidance given by the UNHCR, while not binding, should be accorded considerable weight in light of the obligation of Member States under Article 35 of the Convention to facilitate its duty of supervising the application of the provisions of the Convention (see R v Asfaw [2008] AC 1061, per Lord Bingham at para 13, and R v Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, Ex p Adimi [2001] QB 667, 678). Moreover, in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Adan [2001] 2 AC 477, 520, Lord Steyn described UNHCR guidance concerning the application of the Refugee Convention as having ""high persuasive authority"". The guidance in the Handbook however remains advisory. While assistance may be derived from the Handbook, it is not a lawgiver or a source of law (the view of the Court of Appeal in AH (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2015] EWCA Civ 1003, at [12] & [13]). The Supreme Court in Al-Sirri considered the issue of the standard of proof, what was meant by “serious reasons for considering” that a person committed the crimes in question. The Court concluded that it was not appropriate to apply the criminal standard of proof. The Court reached the following conclusions at [75]), in light of the UNHCR’s view that the Refugee Convention must be restrictively interpreted and cautiously applied: “(1) ""Serious reasons"" is stronger than ""reasonable grounds"". (2) The evidence from which those reasons are derived must be ""clear and credible"" or ""strong"". (3) ""Considering"" is stronger than ""suspecting"". In our view it is also stronger than ""believing"". It requires the considered judgment of the decision-maker. (4) The decision-maker need not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt or to the standard required in criminal law. (5) It is unnecessary to import our domestic standards of proof into the question. The circumstances of refugee claims, and the nature of the evidence available, are so variable. However, if the decision-maker is satisfied that it is more likely than not that the applicant has not committed the crimes in question or has not been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, it is difficult to see how there could be serious reasons for considering that he had done so. The reality is that there are unlikely to be sufficiently serious reasons for considering the applicant to be guilty unless the decision-maker can be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he is. But the task of the decision-maker is to apply the words of the Convention (and the Directive) in the particular case.” In AH (Article 1F(b) – ‘serious’) Algeria [2013] UKUT 00382 (IAC) the appellant, an Algerian, was convicted and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment in France in respect of an offence of participation in a criminal association with a terrorist enterprise (the offence involved his close contact with others implicated in terrorist attacks in France, although he was also convicted of a lesser charge of possession of false ID documents). After the appellant claimed asylum in the UK the SSHD considered that he was excluded from the Refugee Convention under Art F1(b). The central issue was whether his offence was a serious one. In considering this question, the Upper Tribunal considered the purpose of 1F(b) and at [85], the Upper Tribunal stated, “It seems clear that the exclusion clause was intended to have two purposes: first, the prevention of abuse of the asylum system by undermining extradition law or the mutual interest amongst states in prosecuting serious offenders. This first reason can have no purchase where the offence has been prosecuted and the offender served his punishment. The second is to exclude from protection those who have demonstrated by their conduct they are not worthy of it. It is this purpose that is relevant here.” The Upper Tribunal therefore recognised a dual purpose in Article 1F(b). At [97] The Tribunal made obiter remarks when considering whether events subsequent to the acts that constituted the basis for exclusion were relevant when considering whether exclusion was justified: “The examination of seriousness should be directed at the criminal acts when they were committed, although events in the supervening passage of time may be relevant to whether exclusion is justified: a formal pardon, or subsequent acquittal, or other event illuminating the nature of the activity may be relevant to this assessment. Despite suggestions to the contrary by respected commentators, it does not appear to be the case that service of the sentence, or indeed a final acquittal, brings the application of the exclusion clause to an end. It may be that the passage of time may serve to remove any basis for exclusion of protection but if so we have no basis for deciding how long a period is appropriate and in reality a claimant who has protection against expulsion is likely to be eligible for settlement on long residence grounds before being able to expiate culpability sufficiently to acquire refugee status.” In Febles v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [2014] SCC 68 Mr Febles, a Cuban national, was admitted to the USA as a refugee from Cuba. Whilst in the USA he was convicted and served time in prison for two assaults. His refugee status was revoked in the USA and he fled to Canada. He maintained that Art 1F(b) was confined to fugitives from justice and, as he had already been convicted and jailed, he was not a fugitive. The Supreme Court (SCC) considered in detail authorities from various jurisdictions and from academic writers and held, by a majority, that the ordinary meaning of 1F(b), its context when considered with 1F(a) and 1F(c), and the object and purposes of the Refugee Convention, did not support the contention that 1F(b) was confined to fugitives. A majority of the SCC rejected obiter dicta to the contrary in Canada (Attorney General) v Ward [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 and Pushpanathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1998] 1 SCR 982. The SCC considered that post-crime events, such as rehabilitation or expiation, were not relevant. The Refugee Convention had the twin purposes of needing to ensure humane treatment of the victims of oppression on the one hand, and the wish of sovereign states to maintain control over those seeking entry to their territory on the other. The SCC concluded that Article 1F(b) serves one main purpose - to exclude persons who have committed a serious crime. “This exclusion is central to the balance the Refugee Convention strikes between helping victims of oppression by allowing them to start new lives in other countries and protecting the interests of receiving countries. Article 1F(b) is not directed solely at fugitives and neither is it directed solely at some subset of serious criminals who are undeserving at the time of the refugee application. Rather, in excluding all claimants who have committed serious non-political crimes, Article 1F(b) expresses the contracting states’ agreement that such persons by definition would be undeserving of refugee protection by reason of their serious criminality” (para 35). In reaching its decision, the SCC relied on a number of decisions from different jurisdictions, including the Upper Tribunal decision in AH (Algeria) and the House of Lords decision in T v SSHD [1996] 2 All E.R. 865, which discussed the purpose of Article 1F generally and indicated that the purpose of Article 1F(b) was not limited to exclusion of fugitives, but that it recognised that there were those whose criminal habits made it unreasonable for them to be forced on to a host nation against its will. The SCC also considered Germany v B and D C-57/09, C-101/09, [2010] ECR I-10979, a case concerning the interpretation of Article 12 (2)(b) & (c) of the Qualification Directive (Directive 2004/83/EC) involving two Turkish nationals who had been involved in proscribed terrorist organisations prior to their admittance to Germany. The CJEU concluded in B and D that the grounds for exclusion were intended as a penalty for acts committed in the past, and that the relevant grounds for exclusion were introduced with the aim of excluding from refugee protection persons who are deemed to be underserving of the protection which that status entails and of preventing that status from enabling those who have committed certain serious crimes to escape criminal liability. In its conclusion the SCC stated, at para 60, “Article 1F(b) excludes anyone who has ever committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee. Its application is not limited to fugitives, and neither is the seriousness of the crime to be balanced against factors extraneous to the crime such as present or future danger to the host society or post-crime rehabilitation or expiation.” As was the case before us, the SCC considered its earlier decisions in Ward and Puspanathan and the contribution by Professor Hathaway to the interpretation of Article 1F(b) (being confined to fugitives from justice). The Court also considered the shift by Professor Goodwin Gill in his position from 1996 (The Refugee in International Law - 2nd Ed 1996- “ordinary criminals…extraditable by treaty) to the 3rd edition in 2017 (“fugitives from justice … appears to be on the wain”). McLachlin CJ began his review of case law with this conclusion at [43], “Courts around the world have suggested various rationales for the inclusion of Article 1F(b) in the Refugee Convention and have interpreted the provision in different ways. While the jurisprudence is inconclusive as to the precise scope and all of the rationales, there is agreement that Article 1F(b) is not limited to fugitives. After reviewing the foreign jurisprudence, I conclude that the interpretation adopted by the German Federal Administrative Court and the European Court of Justice, that Article 1F(b) excludes anyone who has previously committed a serious non-political crime, is the most consistent with both the prevailing trend in the case law and the text of the provision.” With respect we agree with the reasoning of the SCC and are not persuaded that Professor Hathaway is correct in his interpretation that Article 1F(b) is confined to fugitives from justice and includes those who have been convicted and in certain cases those who have been acquitted. The UNHCR has published a Background Note on Application of the Exclusion Clauses and Guidelines have been provided by the UNHCR Executive Committee (No 82(XLVIII) 1997). These set out the rationale for exclusion under 1F. With relevance to 1F(b) the objective is that the refugee framework should not stand in the way of serious criminals facing justice. The exclusion clauses should be applied scrupulously to protect the Convention’s integrity and to prevent abuse. The UNHCR Handbook raises the question at [159] whether hijacking to escape from persecution constitutes a non-political crime and at [160] the alternatives given to Contracting States of extradition (which was not available in this case) or instituting proceedings domestically (as if fact happened). [161] concludes with the observation that “the question of exclusion under Article 1F(b) of an applicant who has committed an unlawful seizure of an aircraft will also have to be carefully examined in each individual case.” The submissions from Mr Seddon under this heading, supplemented by Mr Jorro on behalf of the eight appellants can be summarised as follows: When a conviction is quashed in the Court of Appeal without any order for retrial, with reference to Archbold at 4-195 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 s.2(3), an appellant is “in the same position for all purposes as if he had actually been acquitted”: per Lord Reading CJ in R v Barron 10 Cr.App.R. 81 at 88. The submissions made to the 2015 Panel were correct as a matter of law. Article 1F falls to be restrictively and cautiously applied supported by the authorities above. The views of UNHCR are to be given “considerable weight”: Al-Sirri. The ‘extradition’ based rationale for 1F(b) is apparent in its temporal and geographic restriction when compared with 1F(a) and (c) consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the travaux preparatoires to the Refugee Convention. Criminal liability for the hijacking was justiciable outside and within the UK given that the alleged offence covered the period from the taking of the aircraft in Kabul, a scenario engaged in the Handbook. Although it was accepted that exclusion might still apply to those who have been convicted of a serious crime and served their sentence, the appellants cannot be regarded as “serious criminals” because the legal process had led to an outcome that they were not guilty. As a consequence, the institution and integrity of the Convention is neither undermined or abused. The 2004 Panel determination did not provide a basis for exclusion and its passages from Goodwin- Gill do not address the situation where a criminal process has been discharged with no finding of guilt. Although in most exclusion cases, the nature of the evidence would render it impractical for the receiving state to be able only to exclude where a criminal prosecution could be brought, here, it would be contrary to the principle of a restrictive and cautious application of Article 1F where exclusion was considered (applying the lower standard of proof) on the basis of a crime for which there had been an acquittal. Equal treatment requires those who have been acquitted to be treated the same as those who have not committed an offence. The burden was on the Secretary of State to justify exclusion where there has been an acquittal. A restrictive approach required a halt to exclusion in the light of the acquittal. Mr Jacobs reminds us in his submissions that KU had been formally acquitted of all charges as the Crown had elected to offer no evidence against him. He was involved in the preparation for the hijacking and was aware of the intentions of the group when he boarded but had become unwell and the medical evidence established that he was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of hijacking. He emphasised that the absence of any authority for the proposition that exclusion could still apply where there had been an acquittal and exclusion would be inconsistent with the restrictive and cautious approach the Secretary of State was required to take and with the principles in Al-Siri. KU has received an absolute acquittal and there had been no findings made against him. The 2015 panel had erred in relying on Blake J’s obiter observations in AH; there was never any issue before the tribunal as to the approach to be adopted towards 1F(b) in AH which was concerned with 1F(c). Mr Jacobs argued that the facts in Al-Sirri were very different. He had been acquitted in the central criminal court on an indictment for the murder but the charge had been dismissed on the basis that the evidence would not be sufficient for the jury to properly convict. In the absence of that conviction the Secretary of State chose to proceed under 1F(c). There was no consideration in the case of whether 1F(b) applied. The 2015 Panel had erred in relying on the passage from Al-Sirri at [75] of the judgment as authority for the proposition that an acquittal does not prevent the application of 1F(b); the issue was never before the Supreme Court. The 2015 Panel had failed to apply the requisite purposive approach to its determination of the exclusion issue: AH (Algeria) and had failed to consider the UNHCR position. Mr Payne’s written submissions on the issue of the effect of the acquittal addressed the object of 1F(b) with reference to Febles which considered the intervention by UNHCR. He argues that appellants had repeated arguments that had been considered and rejected by the 2004 and 2015 Panels without engaging with the reasoning in the determinations. The appellants had failed to refer either to AH (Algeria) or Febles. There was no engagement with the findings in those cases that 1F(b) was not extradition based and/or has the sole purpose of ensuring that refugee claimants are held accountable for their past conduct. The appeal against conviction in the Court of Appeal was allowed due to a misdirection and the Court commented on the seriousness of their actions and the force of the suggestion that the misdirection was not material in relation to the hijacking in Moscow and Stansted. The decision not to prosecute subsequent to the Court of Appeal decision reflected the fact that they had largely served their sentences. Although it was correct to say that they had not been convicted, it is clear that there was compelling evidence to suggest that the appellants had committed serious crimes. At no stage did their evidence result in an acquittal. Even if they had been acquitted this would not have prevented application of 1F(b) which does not require a conviction, an acquittal can be for procedural reasons and there are different standards of proof between criminal proceedings and exclusion as recognised by Lady Hale in Al-Sirri. The decision not to prosecute KU had nothing to do with the strength of evidence against him but it reflected an assessment that he was not fit to stand trial. The 2015 Panel had given compelling reasons why leading up to the hijacking he had aided and abetted the commission of a serious crime. In his oral submissions, Mr Payne engaged with a point that we had raised during the appellants’ submissions with regard to the mandatory nature of the provisions in 1F reflected in the Qualification Directive and the 2006 Regulations. He argued that the decision whether someone was entitled to be recognised as a refugee remained a matter for the Secretary of State. In determining whether exclusion was appropriate, it was irrelevant that someone had finished serving a sentence. Mr Payne referred to the mandatory provisions of 1F and the absence of any mention in 1F(b) of any reference to whether an acquittal or conviction was determinative of an application for protection. If it is accepted that there is no requirement for a conviction in 1F(a) and (c) or there is no bar to (a) and (c) being engaged if there is an acquittal, there was no reason why an acquittal should be a bar to (b). He contended that the appellants had sought to extend and rewrite the words of 1F(b) in a manner inconsistent with its mandatory nature. It was inappropriate to have criminal proceedings being determinative of refugee proceedings in reliance on M. It was clear from a consistent line of cases (being AH and Febles) that there is a dual purpose to 1F(b) and that it was not confined as contended by the appellants to extradition principles but included consideration of whether someone was entitled to refugee protection for which there did not need to be a conviction. Mr Payne also argued that it was clear that there may be compelling reasons for applying 1F(b) even where there has been an acquittal given the wide variety of reasons for such a result which ranged from a finding by the jury to technical grounds such as non-attendance of a witness. There were very different rules of evidence in criminal proceedings. By way of reply, Mr Jorro with Mr Seddon submitted that there was a clear distinguishing feature between a person who has committed a crime and where a person has been convicted or acquitted of crime. The proper place for determining whether someone has committed a crime is the criminal court. Febles dealt with a person convicted in another country and the observations in B and D and AH were not part of the ratios in those decisions. There was no binding authority that a person convicted can be excluded. The use of the lower standard as referred to in AH was unprincipled and inconsistent with the restrictive approach. Al-Sirri was not such an example as the Secretary of State has chosen to rely on 1F(c). Mr Jacobs added that the Laws LJ in AH had not endorsed the observations by Blake J which had been referenced in Febles. As to his fourth ground relating to discretion, courts must be able to act judicially and should not be overly restrictive. Both sides argued that the absence of authorities supports the strength of their respective positions. By way of conclusion, we accept Mr Payne’s submission that the Secretary of State has a positive obligation to consider exclusion in relation to each of the limbs of Article 1F. That obligation is expressed also in Article 12 of the Qualification Directive and in paragraph 7 of the 2006 Regulations transposing the Directive. Applying the ordinary meaning of the Convention’s terms, exclusion is a mandatory requirement where someone has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to admission as a refugee. We also accept that the decision-maker on whether someone is in need of protection or is excluded is the Secretary of State. As observed by Hayden J in F & Others v SSHD [2018] 2 WLR 178 at [27]: “In the UK, in compliance with this framework of requirements Parliament has, through the immigration rules (HC 395), appointed the Secretary of State for the Home Department as the designated single ‘determining authority’. As such it is the SSHD who is the sole responsibility for investigating and determining claims for international protection. … For the sake of completeness, the Immigration Rules are made pursuant to the Immigration Act 1971 (‘the 1971 Act’). Accordingly and given that these powers are rooted within this statutory framework, the SSHD submits, and I agree, that the grant of asylum is not made pursuant to Royal Prerogative but reflects and exercise of statutory authority. No party has sought at this hearing, to argue to the contrary. This discrete question has, to my mind now been comprehensively resolved by the Supreme Court: Munir v SSHD [2012] UKSC 32. …” Further at [33] Hayden J observed: “I agree with Mr Payne's analysis, it follows, from the above that the governmental, administrative, judicial bodies of Member States are required to adopt an approach to those seeking or granted asylum that furthers the objectives of the Convention, to do otherwise would frustrate its primary purpose, …” It is unarguable as a matter of law that the first eight appellants have been acquitted of the five counts on which they were charged. In these proceedings we are concerned only with the first count in the light of the geographical restriction in Article 1F(b) which relates to the hijacking from its inception and as a continuing offence until arrival within the territory of the United Kingdom. Longmore LJ describes count 1 in paragraph [2] of his judgment as follows: “Count 1 charged the appellants with hijacking the aircraft, using various weapons to threaten those on board and making threats to blow it up, and covered the period from taking over the plane shortly after take-off, to the time of its landing at Stansted.” As he observed counts 2 to 5 arose out of events after landing at Stansted. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that there was a misdirection by the trial judge in the case which Longmore LJ would not agree was inconsequential. As explained at [29] of his judgment: “For these reasons, we were satisfied that there was a misdirection in this case. Mr Houlder submitted that the misdirection did not matter because the Crown always accepted that, if the defendants’ evidence were believed, there was a sufficient threat in fact to enable them to raise the defence of duress. We cannot agree that the misdirection was inconsequential in that sense. First, once the ruling had been made at a comparatively early stage of the trial on 26th October, before the close of the prosecution case, the belief of the defendants, if the jury were sure that there was no threat, became legally irrelevant. The jury may have rejected the evidence, say, about the list of 35 named, but were never able to take the defendants’ actual fear into account. Secondly, the Crown always put their case of hijacking on two bases (a) the hijacking of the aircraft in Afghanistan and (b) the continuation of the hijacking in Moscow. The Crown never accepted that there were threats in fact in Moscow but the defendants asserted that they believed they would be sent back to their death in Afghanistan (directly or via Pakistan) by the Moscow authorities and also that they believed that, if they allowed the passengers to leave, the authorities would storm the plane. That was evidence which the jury was unable to take into account, if again, if they were sure there was no threat. We were informed by counsel that, when it came to sentencing, the judge observed that he could not be sure that the defence of duress had not succeeded in relation to the initial hijacking. The 5 year sentence imposed by the judge reflected, therefore, what happened in Moscow rather than the original hijacking.” Longmore LJ however also observed in his concluding remarks at [33] as follows: “In the light of some of the newspaper comments on the announcement of our decision, we think it right to add that we do not for a moment accept that the success of this appeal is a charter for future hijackers. The only reason why this appeal has succeeded is that there was a misdirection in relation to the law as explained to the jury. As earlier jury was given a direction that, in one respect may have been too generous to the defendants, and was unable to agree. We have every confidence that future juries given a correct direction, in accordance with the law set out in R v Graham in 1982, will convict in appropriate cases and acquit, if it is right to do so.” KU was acquitted on all five counts as a consequence of the Crown not offering evidence. It is not in dispute that this was because he was not fit to enter a plea. The established authorities have endorsed the UNHCR view that the Refugee Convention must be restrictively interpreted and cautiously applied as explained in Al-Sirri. The appellants’ principal point is that their acquittals, by taking a cautious and restrictive approach to the exclusion, meant that there were no longer serious reasons for considering they had committed a serious non-political crime. In our judgment the Supreme Court in Febles correctly interpreted the purpose behind Article 1F(b) having had regard to the travoux preparatoires and the authorities including the CJEU in B and D. As explained by the court at [35]: “I cannot accept the arguments of Mr Febles and the UNHCR on the purposes of Article 1F(b). I conclude that Article 1F(b) serves one main purpose – to exclude persons who have committed a serious crime. This exclusion is central to the balance the Refugee Convention strikes between helping victims of oppression by allowing them to start new lives in other countries and protecting the interests of receiving countries. Article 1F(b) is not directed solely at fugitives and neither is it directed solely at some subset of serious criminals who are undeserving at the time of the refugee application. Rather, in excluding all claimants who have committed serious non-political crimes, Article 1F(b) expresses the contracting states’, agreement that such persons by definition would be underserving of refugee protection by reason of their serious criminality.” It follows that the Secretary of State would not be discharging his legal obligations under the Refugee Convention by simply treating without more an acquittal in the criminal courts as an answer to the question whether there are serious grounds for believing a crime has been committed. Even when taking a cautious and restrictive approach, it is incumbent upon the Secretary of State to examine the circumstances of the acquittal to decide whether his obligation has been discharged and that the mandatory exclusion provisions have been satisfied. We readily accept that in most cases an acquittal will provide a compelling answer to the question of whether there are serious reasons. This would usually be so where a jury had returned a verdict of not guilty on counts based on offending that would other give rise to exclusion. However, we agree with Mr Payne that there will be cases where an acquittal arises for procedural, technical or other reasons as was the case for the first eight appellants. KU is another example of where an acquittal may not provide a complete answer to the enquiry. In our judgment, the 2015 panel did not err in looking beyond the acquittal to see whether the appellants were to be excluded. They gave legally sustainable reasons for doing so and correctly identified the issue at [10] where they summarised the arguments that were fully developed before us and at [11] where they addressed the Secretary of State’s position. The 2015 Panel correctly identified the basis on which the Court of Appeal had allowed the eight appellants’ appeals and did not err in taking into account the remarks of Blake J in AH which they correctly acknowledged were overturned. We do not consider that the fact that Blake J was referring to the operation of Article 1F(c) undermined the relevance of his remarks to the articles other provisions. Furthermore, we do not accept that the reference by the 2015 Panel at [14] to the lower standard identified by Baroness Hale in Al-Sirri was erroneous. Although the Panel did not make reference to the mandatory nature of the exclusion provisions and the cautious and restrictive approach required, in our view they were rationally entitled and legally correct in reaching their conclusion that: “… Notwithstanding the appellants’ acquittal and the absence of any finding beyond reasonable doubt that they committed the crime of hijack, it remains open to us to assess whether there are “serious reasons” for considering that they have committed a serious, non-political crime, so as to justify exclusion under Article 1F(b). We conclude that the appellants’ acquittal does not prevent the application of Article 1F(b).” Specifically in respect of KU, the 2015 Panel correctly noted his formal acquittal and the basis for that at [49]. Nevertheless, taking account of their approach to the eight appellants, we are not persuaded that they erred in considering whether there were also serious reasons for considering KU’s position notwithstanding his acquittal by reference to the nature of the medical evidence and the fact that KU was not fit to plea. This aspect is adequately reasoned and reflects a correct legal approach. DURESS The appellants accept that if the 2015 Panel was entitled to look beyond the acquittal it is necessary to consider the issue of duress which has the same potential to arrest any further consideration of 1F(b) if made out. In Graham [1982] 1 WLR 294 the Court of Appeal considered the elements of the defence of duress. The case concerned a gay man who participated in the murder of his wife because, he claimed, he was in fear of his co-accused and lover, a man called King. At issue was whether the judge gave a lawful direction to the jury by requiring the jury to consider whether a reasonable person with the appellant’s characteristics would have behaved in the way the appellant did, importing an objective element. Lord Lane stated that, “As a matter of public policy, it seems to us essential to limit the defence of duress by means of an objective criterion formulated in terms of reasonableness. The correct direction to the jury should have been: Was the defendant, or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because, as a result of what he reasonably believed King had said or done, he has good cause to fear that if he did not so act King would kill him or cause him serious physical injury? If so, have the prosecution made the jury sure that a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the defendant, would not have responded to whatever he reasonably believed King said or did by taking part in the killing?” In R v Safi (Ali Ahmed) and Ors [2003] EWCA Crim 1809, a decision arising from the prosecution of the current appellants, the Court of Appeal concluded that Sir Edwin Jowitt misdirected the jury by requiring that there must be a threat in fact, rather than something the appellants reasonably believed to be a threat, before the defence of duress could be invoked. The Court of Appeal held that the suggested direction in Graham continues to be the law in relation to duress. The Court of Appeal considered a number of authorities including Abdul-Hussain (noted in [1999] Crim. L. Rev. 570), which involved another hijacking of a plane by Shiite Muslims from Iraq. In this case the Court held that imminent peril of death or serious injury had to operate on the defendant at the time he committed the act so as to overbear his will, but the execution of the threat did not need to be immediately in prospect. Rose LJ V-P said, “If Anne Frank had stolen a car to escape from Amsterdam and had been charged with theft, the tenets of English law would not, in our judgment, have denied her a defence of duress of circumstances, on the ground that she should have waited for the Gestapo’s knock on the door.” According to the Court of Appeal in Safi the relevant authorities stressed the need for great and imminent danger and required that a defendant’s response to the situation be judged by an objective standard of reasonableness and proportionality. R v Z [2005] UKHL 22 was concerned with the issue whether the defence of duress was available to someone who voluntarily associated with known criminals. The House of Lords noted that duress affords a defence which, if raised and not disproved, exonerates the defendant altogether. “Where the evidence in the proceedings is sufficient to raise an issue of duress, the burden is on the prosecution to establish to the criminal standard that the defendant did not commit the crime with which he is charged under duress” (at [20]). The House of Lords did not suggest that the Graham direction, approved in R v Howe [1987] AC 417, was inappropriate. Their Lordships stated, “It is of course essential that the defendant should genuinely, i.e. actually, believe in the efficacy of the threat by which he claims to have been compelled. But there is no warrant for relaxing the requirement that the belief must be reasonable as well as genuine.” The respondent and the 2015 Panel relies on MT (Article 1F (a) – aiding and abetting) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 00015 (IAC), where the Upper Tribunal held that a person falls to be excluded under 1F(b) where there are serious reasons for considering that he or she has aided and abetted the commission of a serious non-political crime. The case concerned a Zimbabwean policewoman whom the SSHD excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention under Articles 1F(a) and (c) (the case did not concern Art 1F(b) and the Upper Tribunal only considered 1F(b) on an obiter basis – see [96]) because of her participation in various incidents involving serious human rights abuses. She argued that she was entitled to the defence of duress. The issue of duress was considered with respect to Art 1F(a) and Article 31(1)(d) of the ICC Statute. While recognising that it was unclear whether duress provided a complete defence in all cases in the context of the exclusion clauses, the Upper Tribunal in MT(Zimbabwe), stated, at [106]: “We believe we can dispose of the duress claim relatively briefly. Article 31(1)(d) of the ICC Statute makes clear that duress can be a defence to international criminal responsibility. In draft Article 9 (dealing with 'Exceptions to the principle of responsibility') the International Law Commission (ILC) UN GAOR Supp.No.10: UN doc. A/42/10/ (1987) at 18 noted that for 'coercion to be considered as an exception, the perpetrator of the incriminating act must be able to show that he would have placed himself in grave imminent and irremediable peril if he had offered any resistance'. Whether it is a complete defence and whether it can apply in all types of cases remains unsettled: see the Trial Chamber discussions in Prosecutor v Endermovic (IT-96-22) 7 June 1997 (a case, like all the other overseas cases to which we refer elsewhere in this decision -unless otherwise specified- decided by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia or ICTFY). It appears uncontroversial, however, that such a defence is confined to situations where the defendant's freedom of will and decision is so severely limited that there is eventually no moral choice of counter activity available; and that it has four components: the threat must be of imminent death or continuing or imminent serious bodily harm; the threat must result in duress causing the crime; a threat results in duress only if it is otherwise avoidable (i.e. if a reasonable person in comparable circumstances would have submitted and would have been driven to the relevant criminal conduct); and the act directed at avoiding the threat must be necessary in terms of no other means being available and reasonable for reaching the desired effect.” The submissions on behalf of the eight appellants identifies the issue for determination as whether they could reasonably/genuinely have believed that their only safe means of escape was as they did. If they could so have believed, then the Secretary of State has failed to make out the necessary criminal intent for the purposes of exclusion under Article 1F(b) on application of the balance of probabilities standard. Our attention is drawn to the sentencing remarks and Sir Edwin Jowitt’s reasoning and findings which were made on the unlawfully strict test which applied a standard to the appellants’ conduct that was more rigorous than the criminal law applied. That test did not require the appellants in fact to be in imminent peril before the defence of duress was capable of succeeding by reference to R v Graham. With reference to the Graham test, it is submitted that if the answer to the first question set out in paragraph 79 above is ‘no’, guilt is established. If the answer is ‘yes’ the second question requires answering. If the answer to that question is ‘no’ guilt is not proved but if ‘yes’, guilt is established. The appellants also rely on the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Safi as to the immediacy of the threat. The eight appellants’ submissions then turned to the findings of the 2004 Panel. It is argued that the appellants reasonably as well as genuinely believed that taking the aircraft was their only realistic option to avoid the danger. The findings by the 2004 Panel read as a whole positively underline such a belief. Whether speaking objectively they could have attempted another means and whether in fact the danger was not such that they could not have found an alternative is not the point. With the 2004 Panel having found that had the appellants travelled overland, there was a danger they would be identified and thereafter arrested and tortured or worse. It is argued that this aspect of itself given that family members were also involved was sufficient to underline a reasonable/genuine belief whatever the ultimate reality in the appellants’ mind that such was not a realistic choice and taking the aircraft was the only realistic option. Applying the second stage of Graham, it was very hard to see how such a person could have acted in any different way from the appellants in the light of their reasonably/genuinely held beliefs in the very particular circumstances of a group of men facing arrest, torture and death at the hands of a notoriously cruel and ruthless ruling authority. As to the 2004 Panel’s finding that the hijack engaged Article 1F(b) from the outset (the taking of the aircraft in Kabul) the findings of the Criminal Court were to be preferred having heard days of evidence directed to the point. Specifically in respect of the 2015 Panel’s findings it is argued that- The First-tier Tribunal had misdirected itself in law by approaching the issue of duress on the basis of whether there were other possible means of escape that, as a matter of fact, the appellants could have availed themselves of, notwithstanding the risk to them, rather than whether they had a reasonable/genuine belief of circumstances compelling them to act as they did and whether it had been very clearly shown that reasonable persons, sharing their characteristics and in those circumstances, would not have behaved in that way. The 2015 Panel had failed to recognise or have regard to the intense dangers and risks of leaving Afghanistan by alternative means. Its conclusion was not open to it applying the appropriate and correct legal tests. The 2015 Panel had misdirected itself in law by applying too high a standard to the duress test. For KU, Mr Jacobs argued that where there was prime facie evidence of duress that alone should suffice to render Article 1F(b) inapplicable by reference to the text in the Law of Refugee Status, Second Edition, Hathaway and Foster. The 2015 Panel had misdirected itself on the medical evidence which relating to KU would set out a plausible defence of duress. Mr Payne’s submissions identify aspects of the 2015 Panel’s findings with reference to the appellants’ military experience, access to funds, ability to travel to Pakistan for preparation and the absence of any sufficient immediacy of danger or the availability of alternative means for leaving Kabul. The appellants were resourceful with links to Pakistan and the borders were relatively porous to many countries. It is contended that the appellants have not challenged the findings by the 2004 Panel that there was no sufficient immediacy of danger which he contended is fatal to their appeal. Mr Payne also argued that it was significant the appellants chose not to give evidence before the 2015 Panel on these issues. Sir Edwin Jowitt commented in his sentencing remarks that he could not be sure (Mr Payne’s emphasis) that the hijacking was criminal from the outset reflecting an assessment applying the criminal standard to the more limited evidence considered during the criminal trial. Specifically in respect of KU, Mr Payne argued that he had not established that he was acting under duress during the weeks when the preparations were made for the hijacking and the 2015 Panel had noted that he had played a substantial role in the preparation. We reach the following conclusions under this heading. We were drawn in oral submissions to a detailed analysis of the findings by the 2015 Panel with reference to those reached by the Panel in 2004 as well as argument on whether the Panel applied the correct test to the facts found in 2004. It is important to our mind to note that the grounds do not challenge the rationality of the 2015 Panel’s conclusions on the earlier findings in the absence of any further evidence from the appellants. Accordingly, if we are satisfied that the 2015 Panel proceeded on the basis of the correct test or in substance did so the only question that would arise is whether the 2015 Panel erred in its understanding of the evidence and the findings by the 2004 Panel. Drawing upon the above authorities, the questions the 2015 Panel was required to ask themselves may be framed in this way. Were the appellants impelled to hijack a plane as a result of their reasonably and genuinely held belief that the Taliban authorities were pursing them and whether, if they did act in this way was there was a serious and imminent (as opposed to an immediate) threat to their lives or a risk of serious harm? This is the subjective element which also has an objective component as to the reasonableness of the belief. The second question, if the first is answered in the affirmative, is whether others in the same position, with the same characteristics, with the same reasonably held fears of a serious imminent threat would not have hijacked a plane to avoid the threat but would have chosen another course of action. This is the objective analysis that requires to be answered for the defence to be made out. The 2015 Panel explained in [15]: “… The correct approach is to consider whether the appellants had a reasonable belief of circumstances compelling them to act as they did whereas, in contrast, the 2004 Panel approached the matter on the basis of whether there were other possible means of escape that, as a matter of fact, the appellants could have availed themselves of.” This is followed by a short analysis of MT and an extract from that decision which identifies four components at [106] of the decision: “It appears uncontroversial, however, that such a defence is confined to situations where the defendant’s freedom of will and decision is so severely limited that there is eventually no morale choice of counter activity available; and that it is four components: the threat must be of imminent death or continuing or imminent serious bodily harm; the threat must result in duress causing the crime; a threat results in duress only if it is otherwise avoidable (i.e. if a reasonable person in comparable circumstances would have submitted and would have driven to the relevant criminal conduct); and the act directed at avoiding the threat must be necessary in terms of no other means being available and reasonable for reaching the desired effect.” Examination of the 2004 Panel’s decision shows a detailed summary of the evidence given by the eight appellants between [66] and [88]. The reference in [91] to the absence of an immediacy of danger and arrest needs to be considered in context: “91. Having heard the evidence of the appellants and the experts and having read the objective evidence, we are satisfied that the borders of Afghanistan are and were at the relevant time porous relative to many countries. We find that these appellants could have attempted an alternative means of escape to a neighbouring country. There were routes through the mountains and unmanned border posts. We find that despite all of the appellants’ statements to the contrary there was not such an immediacy of danger of arrest or lack of opportunity to move away from the Kabul area such that they could not have found an alternative to hijacking. The appellants could have chosen to travel to Pakistan although there was a strong Taliban and radical Islamic movement presence there. If they had gone to Pakistan, it was most unlikely they would have experienced any particular difficulties moving on from there. The further they travelled from Afghanistan and the Peshawar area, the less likely they would have been in danger. They could have remained elsewhere in Pakistan or if they still felt in danger of persecution they could have travelled on to claim asylum in another country. They could have claimed asylum in Tashkent or in Moscow but chose not to do so.” In paragraph [17] of its decision, the 2015 Panel considered the 2004 Panel’s assessment of the circumstances (see [36] above). This includes an observation that the 2004 Panel “… made a clear finding that there was not such an immediacy of danger of arrest or lack of opportunity to move away …”. The 2015 Panel continued at [18] as we have cited above: “… We find that the evidence before the 2004 Panel, and before ourselves does not show that the threat of serious imminent harm was such that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to hijack the Ariana airplane. There is nothing to displace the clear findings of fact made by the 2004 Panel that there was no such immediacy of danger of arrest or lack of opportunity to move away from Kabul.” The above passage indicates that the 2015 Panel came to a negative answer on the first question. This is followed by a further reference to the absence of evidence to replace the “clear findings of fact made by the 2004 Panel” and a repetition of their survey of the earlier panel’s findings in [17]. This is indicative that although it was unnecessary for them to do so, the 2015 Panel went on to consider the second question with reference to the time allocated to preparation for and the sophisticated planning for the hijack. Whilst the panel might have structured the approach more clearly, in substance, its approach was legally sound and open to them on the evidence. It is correct that the 2004 Panel found that there was an absence of immediacy of danger. We do not consider this fatal to the 2015 Panel’s decision in the light of the later Panel having found that the evidence did not show the “threat of serious imminent harm”. The reference to immediacy is an aspect of the evidence rather than a statement of the test. It was a consideration of the likelihood of events occurring which is an essential ingredient of the consideration whether an event was imminent. In this respect a lack of immediacy might well show something was not imminent. The 2015 Panel gave cogent reasons why, based on the findings by the 2004 Panel, the threat of serious imminent harm was such that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to hijack the Ariana airplane. In concluding that the appellants could have attempted an alternative means of escape, the 2004 Panel were addressing not only the reasonableness of their belief asserted after a careful analysis of all the evidence but also answering the second question. In our judgment the finding that the appellants could have chosen alternative means indicated that their belief that hijacking was the only option available to them was not one that was reasonably or genuinely held or one that a person sharing such a belief would not have done in the light of the alternatives. We conclude therefore that there was no error by the 2015 Panel on the second ground of challenge. We turn to KU. Having satisfied ourselves that the 2015 Panel took the correct approach to the issue of duress for the eight appellants, there was no need for them to repeat their decision in relation to KU. NON-POLITICAL CRIME If the appellants are unable to show that the acquittal provided a complete answer or that they were acting under duress, the next step (and basis of challenge) is whether there are serious reasons for considering the crime was non-political. The cases we were directed to begin with, R v Governor of Brixton ex parte Kolczynski and others [1955] 1 QB 540 concerned Polish sailors serving on a fishing vessel whose views of the communist regime were overheard by a political officer and who thereafter feared they would be prosecuted on return to Poland for their political views. They overpowered the remaining crew (although there was not much resistance except by the political officer) and brought their vessel to the UK where they claimed asylum and were arrested. The Polish government sought their extradition. The case was concerned with the point whether the scheduled offences that were the subject of the extradition request were, in reality, of a political character. The Queen’s Bench Division found that the sailors would be punished as for an offence of a political character. Lord Goddard C.J. stated, “The revolt of the crew was to prevent themselves being prosecuted for a political offence and in my opinion, therefore, the offence had a political character.” Kolczynski was considered in the House of Lords case of R v Governor of Pentonville Prison ex parte Cheng [1973] AC 931. The applicant in Cheng was a member of an organisation opposed to the Taiwan regime and was convicted in the USA of attempted murder of the Taiwanese vice-premier. Having fled the USA and entered the UK, the American authorities sought his extradition. He claimed his offence was “one of a political character.” The House of Lords concluded, by a majority, that political character connoted opposition to the requesting state on some issue connected with the political control or government of that state and, as the offence was committed in the USA and not Taiwan, the offence was not one of a political character. It was unnecessary for the purposes of the issue before their Lordships, to determine the issue of how remote from the physical act the objective had to be (at [945A-D]), although Lord Diplock was of the view that the robbing of a bank to obtain funds for a political party would be too remote to constitute a political offence. Lord Diplock then stated, at 945F, “So, even apart from authority, I would hold that prima facie an act committed in a foreign state was not “an offence of a political character “unless the only purpose sought to be achieved by the offender in committing it were to change the government of the state in which it was committed, or to induce it to change its policy, or to enable him to escape from the jurisdiction of a government of whose political policies the offender disapproved but despaired of altering so long as he was there.” [our emphasis] In T v Immigration Officer [1996] AC 742 the applicant, an Algerian national, was a member of an political movement prepared to use violence to achieve its aims. T had been involved in and had prior knowledge of a bomb attack at an airport that killed 10 people, and had been engaged in planning a raid on an army barracks to obtain weapons that involved a further death. The issue was whether he was excluded from the Refugee Convention under Article 1F(b) on the basis that his offence was not political. Although all members of the House of Lords agreed that the offence was not political, their reasons differed. The majority agreed with Lord Lloyd of Berwick. He stated that it was common ground that the words “non-political crime” must bear the same meaning as they do in extradition law, and said it appeared from the travaux preparatoires that the framers of the Convention had extradition law in mind when drafting the Convention. Lord Lloyd referred to a number of decisions from different jurisdictions, including refugee cases from Canada ((Gil v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1994] F.C.J No. 1559, concerning an Iranian dissident who planted bombs on the business premises of the regime’s supporters and which resulted in the deaths of many innocent bystanders) and the USA (McMullen v Immigration and Naturalization Service, 788 F.2d 591, concerning an application for deportation of a former member of the Provisional IRA), as well as to Cheng. Lord Lloyd also referred to the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status and the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism (1977) (Cmnd. 7031), which represented an attempt to limit by agreement among member states the availability of the political exception in extradition cases. Although member states were entitled to enter a reservation at the time of signing or depositing its instrument of ratification, such states undertook to take into due consideration, when evaluating the character of an offence, any particularly serious aspects of the offence, including, “(a) that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons; or (b) that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it: or (c) that cruel or vicious means have been used in the commission of the offence.” At 786H to 787B Lord Lloyd defined a political crime. “A crime is a political crime for the purposes of article 1F(b) of the Geneva Convention if, and only if (1) it is committed for a political purpose, that is to say, with the object of overthrowing or subverting or changing the government of a state or inducing it to change its policy; and (2) there is a sufficiently close and direct link between the crime and the alleged political purpose. In determining whether such a link exists, the court will bear in mind the means used to achieve the political end, and will have particular regard to whether the crime was aimed at a military or governmental target, on the one hand, or a civilian target on the other, and in either event whether it was likely to involve the indiscriminate killing or injuring of members of the public.” At 787C Lord Lloyd provided the following qualification, “Although I have referred to the above statement as a definition, I bear in mind Lord Radcliffe’s warning in Reg. v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Schtraks [1964] A.C. 556, 589, that a question which was first posed judicially more than 100 years ago in In re Castioni [1891] 1 Q.B. 149 is unlikely now to receive a definitive answer. The most that can be attempted is a description of an idea. But to fall short of a description would, in Lord Radcliffe’s words, be to abdicate a necessary responsibility, if the idea of a political crime is to continue to form part of the apparatus of judicial decision-making.” The 2015 Panel considered this limb between paragraphs [29] and [48] in which they reviewed the “relatively few” authorities (Cheng and T) and the approach of the UNHCR. The panel then turned to the evidence beginning with the remarks by Sir Edwin Jowitt in respect of the political nature of the crime. Thereafter the panel returned to the 2004 Panel’s findings on the alternative to the hijacking as cited above in paragraph [99]. The 2015 Panel’s conclusions are hinted at in the preceding paragraphs but finally reached a full expression in [47] as follows: “The 2004 panel’s findings show an acceptance of the existence of the YIA and a political programme and aims which were similar, as Mr Jorro said, to the programme eventually established by means of the Bonn agreement. Political demands were made by the hijackers, at Stansted. Our assessment, however, is that the hijack itself, preceded by detailed and sophisticated planning, and amounting to an offence with separate, relevant episodes in Tashkent and Moscow, was a non-political crime. The principal aim in seizing the aircraft was to make good the escape of the appellants and their family members. We have adopted the 2004 panel’s finding that a viable alternative existed, to leave Afghanistan by other means, perhaps for Pakistan. Applying the test identified in T, we find that the Ariana aircraft was seized in order to effect an escape from Afghanistan rather than to achieve a political purpose, even though the appellants were members of the YIA with political aims and objectives opposed to those of Taliban. We also conclude that no sufficiently close and direct link between the hijack and the alleged political purpose exists. The hijack was directed at a civilian target as the aircraft was not a military vehicle and it contained a wholly innocent flight crew and about 100 passengers not associated with the appellants or their families. Hijacking is, by its very nature, to a large extend a chaotic and uncertain event and, taking into account the weapons taken on board, it was likely to involve at the very least a risk of injury to members of the public. In the event, violence was meted out to the stewards on board.” By way of submissions My Jorro on behalf of the eight appellants, and Mr Jacobs on behalf of KU, reminded us that the appellants were members of a political organisation ideologically opposed to the Taliban controlled government, that arrest warrants had been issued in some of their names on the basis that they were traitors, that they could not ‘stand their ground’ and fight the Taliban, and that the hijack was motivated by a desire to escape political persecution arising from their political activity with the YIA. The political nature of the offence was demonstrated by reference to the Taliban’s reaction to what they perceived as a significant political humiliation, and this was supported by the findings of the panels in 2004 and 2013. Mr Jorro relied on the excerpt from the judgment of Lord Diplock in Cheng set out above at [108] and the decision in Kolczynski, and invited us to find that a person can commit a political offence by escaping from a regime and that the hijacking of the aircraft in Afghanistan clearly fitted within the meaning of a political offence contained in ‘T’. Mr Jorro drew to our attention to an extract in T setting out the views of Goodwin-Gill in The Refugee in International Law (1983), who considered it was necessary to examine, inter alia, whether there was a close and direct causal link between the crime committed and its alleged political purpose, and who stated that the political element should in principle outweigh the common-law character of the offence, which may not be the case of the acts committed or grossly disproportionate to the objective, or of an atrocious or barbarous nature. Mr Jorro additionally drew our attention to an extract in ‘T’ from the UNHCR handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status which indicated that there should be a close and direct causal link between the crime committed and its alleged political purpose and object, that the political element of the offence should also outweigh its common-law character, and that this would not be the case if the acts committed are grossly out of proportion to the alleged objective. He also directed us to the Advocate General’s opinion in Federal Republic of Germany v B & D [2012] 1 WLR 1076 who stated, with reference to article 12(2)(b) of the Qualification Directive (2004/83) (“particular cruel actions, even if committed with an allegedly political objective, may be classified as serious non-political crimes”), that the term “particularly cruel actions” should be applied, not only to the crimes subject to prosecution under the international instruments for the protection of human rights and humanitarian law, but also to crimes which involve the use of abnormal and indiscriminate violence, especially when directed at civilian targets. Mr Jacobs reminded us that the appellants made political demands after landing at Stansted and that, as they were fleeing from political persecution, there was “unreality” in concluding that their actions were not political. He also invited us to note how the appellants actions were viewed by the Taliban. Mr Payne reminded us that at [46] of its decision the 2015 Panel took into account art 12(2)(b) of the Qualification Directive and the mention of “particularly cruel actions” but found that this did not substantially assist in their application of the autonomous meaning of Article 1F(b). The appellants had in any event conceded that the crime was a “serious crime”. He submitted that Mr Jorro inappropriately sought to minimise the seriousness of the crime so that it did not fall within art 12(2)(b) of the Qualification Directive. Mr Payne submitted that in Cheng the House of Lords was dealing with the narrow point of whether an offence committed in the jurisdiction of the state seeking extradition and which related to a political issue in a 3rd country could itself be considered a political offence. In stating that an “offence of a political character” could include, inter alia, an act by a person “… to enable him to escape from the jurisdiction of the government of whose political policies he disapproved but despaired of altering so long as he was there”, Lord Diplock was dealing with what could amount to an offence of a political character, not one that did amount to an offence of a political character, and was not dealing with issues of remoteness because this did not arise in the case. Mr Payne directed us to the definition of political offence in ‘T’ and to the 2004 Panel’s reliance on the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism 1977. He submitted that the 2015 Panel correctly cited the test in ‘T’ and that it explained in detail why there was a viable alternative available to the appellants by leaving through Pakistan. The 2015 Panel were reasonably entitled to find that there was no political purpose to the offence for the reasons given, but even if this was wrong, the 2015 Panel’s conclusion that there was no sufficiently close link between the offence and its political purpose was reasonably open to it and that it properly took into account relevant factors such as the risk of violence and the civilian nature of the target. We are satisfied that a crime committed to effect an escape from political oppression that threatens harm has a political nature; see Lord Diplock [108] above, but there is a need to assess the link between the crime and the political object to see whether this resulted in disqualification from such status, see Lloyd LJ in T at 787G. In our view there is a need for the crime, in order to maintain its political character, to be proportionate to the purpose pursued. In our judgment the 2015 Panel erred in law in their reasoning, at [47], that the offence did not have a political purpose. An offence may be of a political character and may be politically motivated even if it has been the subject of “detailed and sophisticated planning”. Whilst we have no doubt that the 2015 Panel were accurate in stating that the “principal aim in seizing the aircraft was to make good the escape of the appellants and their family members”, the escape was due to a fear of politically motivated persecution based in turn on the appellants’ political activities. The purpose was to escape political persecution. The 2015 Panel concluded, applying ‘T’, that the seizing of the aircraft was not to achieve a political purpose. However, as Lord Lloyd explained at 787C, with reference to his definition, that “the most that can be attempted is a description of an idea.” We are not however persuaded that this error is of material kind that could have led to a different outcome or that there are other features that require the decision to be set aside. The critical passages are in [47]. We are satisfied that the 2015 Panel were unarguably entitled on the findings by the 2004 Panel to find, as they did at [47], that the second limb of the test for a political offence in ‘T’ was not met. The 2015 Panel gave adequate reasons for their conclusion that there was no sufficiently close and direct link between the hijacking and its political purpose. The 2015 Panel noted that the hijack was directed at a civilian target and that the flight contained a wholly innocent flight crew and about a hundred passengers not associated with the appellants or their families. The 2015 Panel also observed that, by its very nature, hijacking was a chaotic and uncertain event and that by taking weapons on board the flight, it was likely to involve at the very least a risk of injury to members of the public. The 2015 Panel indicated that they had referred to the Handbook and although not necessary for our conclusion we note that the serious nature of a hijacking of a plane is reflected in Article 1(a) of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism 1977 which provides that, for the purpose of extradition between states, the hijacking of a plane shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. There is no need for the appellants’ actions to amount to “particularly cruel actions” within the terms of art 12(2)(b) of the Qualification Directive in order for the hijacking of a commercial airline carrying over hundred innocent passengers, with the concomitant risk to lives and safety, to be found a disproportionate and remote response to the threat from the Taliban as perceived by the appellants. The Qualification Directive does not restrict the class of offences that may be classified as serious non-political crimes to those involving particularly cruel actions. It is, in any event, sufficiently clear from the evidence considered by the 2015 Panel that the hijacking was a serious offence (as we have already observed, a point not disputed by the appellants’ representatives) that caused great fear and anxiety for the innocent passengers who were detained for a significant period of time. Moreover, it follows from our earlier conclusions on the approach to the issue of duress that the 2015 Panel were entitled to find that the hijacking of the plane was too remote/disproportionate to the political purpose of escaping political persecution given that reasonable persons facing the same perceived risk and sharing the same characteristics would not have hijacked the plane. Their finding that there was no sufficiently close and direct link between the hijacking and the political character of the escape was drawn from their conclusions on duress, an approach properly open to them when assessing the remoteness of the connection between the political purpose and the hijacking. EXPIATION The appellants have reserved their position on this aspect in the light of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in AH (Algeria) v SSHD (No 2) [2015] EWCA Civ 1003 which post-dated the decision of the 2015 Panel. We are invited to dismiss the appeal on this ground as a consequence although the position of the parties is reserved. DISCRETION (KU) Mr Jacobs submits that the 2015 Panel erred in failing to exercise a discretion not to exclude KU from the Refugee Convention given the particularly unusual facts of KU’s appeal and the evidence before it. In his skeleton argument prepared for the 2015 Panel, Mr Jacobs relied on the medical evidence relating to KU as well as his acquittal, the nine-year delay in making a decision in respect of his protection claim, the passage of nearly 15 years, the issue of duress and the ongoing threat of persecution in Afghanistan as factors relevant to the exercise of discretion. He submitted before us that it was incumbent on Courts and Tribunals to consider the question of exclusion in relation to context and proportionality, and that the judicial The 2015 Panel did not deal with Mr Jacobs’ discretion ground as a discrete head but it did consider the medical evidence relating to KU at [49] to [51], when concluding at [52] that KU was in substantially the same position as the other hijackers and was therefore also excluded from the Refugee Convention. The 2015 Panel also considered the relevance of factors extraneous to the core elements of Article 1F(b) in its assessment of the expiation ground (from [20] to [22]). We are not persuaded that the 2015 Panel fell into error in failing to exercise a discretion. The wording of Article 1F(b) itself is in mandatory terms (“The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that … he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee”). The Secretary of State has a positive obligation to exclude a person who meets the requirements of each of the limbs of Article 1F. In his skeleton argument prepared for the 2015 Panel (and his skeleton argument prepared for this appeal) Mr Jacobs relied on the following passage from The Refugee in International Law, 3rd Edtn, Professor Goodwin-Gill ""Each State must determine what constitutes a serious crime, according to its own standards up to a point, but on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the words considered in context and with the objectives of the 1951 Convention. Given that the words are not self-applying, each party has some discretion in determining whether the criminal character of the applicant for refugee status in fact outweighs his or her character as bona fide refugee, and so constitutes a threat to its internal order. Just as the 1951 Conference rejected 'extradition crimes' as an a priori excludable category, so ad hoc approaches founded on length of sentence are of little help, unless related to the nature and circumstances of the offence. Commentators and jurisprudence seem to agree, however, that serious crimes, above all, are those against physical integrity, life and liberty."" (page 176) Prof Goodwin-Gill’s comments on discretion relate to an individual’s ‘criminal character’ and are made in relation to a discussion of what constitutes a ‘serious crime’. This is apparent not only from the extract itself but from the context in which the extract was considered by the Court of Appeal in AH (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 395 (at [31] & [32]). We do not find the extract supports Mr Jacobs’ contention that the 2015 Panel had a discretion whether to exclude KU from the Refugee Convention. Mr Jacobs additionally relied on a further passage from The Refugee in International Law under the heading ‘Context and proportionality’ which considered the UNHCR’s 2003 Guidelines on exclusion and in which the UNHCR argued that the exclusion clauses must be applied in a manner proportionate to their objective, so that the gravity of the offence in question is weighed against the consequences for exclusion. He also drew our attention to passages in the UNHCR Background Note on the Application of the Exclusion Clauses, and to paragraph 161 of the UNHCR Handbook “While there is thus a possibility of granting asylum, the gravity of the persecution of which the offender may have been in fear, and the extent to which such fear is well-founded, will have to be duly considered in determining his possible refugee status under the 1951 Convention. The question of the exclusion under Article 1 F (b) of an applicant who has committed an unlawful seizure of an aircraft will also have to be carefully examined in each individual case”. We do not consider that the passages assist Mr Jacobs. The commentaries related to the need to approach the evidential requirements of Article 1F(b) with the most anxious scrutiny in circumstances where there is credible evidence of likely persecution, and the issue of proportionality related to the seriousness of the offence. Neither the UNHCR nor Professor Goodwin-Gill were suggesting that there exists a discretion to not exclude once the core elements of Article 1F(b) were established. We remind ourselves in any event that the guidance provided by the UNHCR is advisory (AH (Algeria) [2015] EWCA Civ 1003). In support of his submissions, Mr Jacobs also relied in paragraph 73 of Pushpanathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1998] 1 SCR 982: “Article 1F(b) contains a balancing mechanism so far as the specific adjectives “serious” and “non-political” must be satisfied, while Article 33(2) as implemented in the Act by ss. 53 and 19 provides for weighing of the seriousness of the danger posed to Canadian society against the danger of persecution upon refoulement. This approach reflects the intention of the signatory states to create a humanitarian balance between the individual in fear of persecution on the one hand, and the legitimate concerns of states to sanction criminal activity on the other.” Pushpanathan was however a case concerned with Article 1F(c) and not with Article 1F(b). Moreover, the ‘balancing mechanism’ within Article 1F(b) considered by the Supreme Court of Canada related to the “serious” nature of the crime, and whether the crime was “non-political”, and not to whether there existed a discretion to exclude from the Refugee Convention once the core elements of Article 1F(b) had been established. The appellants accept that the hijacking of the plane was “serious”, and, for the reasons already given, we are satisfied that the 2015 Panel were entitled to find that the appellants’ conduct, when considered in the full context of their actions, was “non-political”. In assessing whether there exists a discretion whether or not to exclude an individual from the Refugee Convention, we additionally note that the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Febles, decided after Pushpanathan, found that factors extraneous to the core elements of Article 1F(b) were not relevant to the question of exclusion. “18. The mandatory wording of the Article (“shall not apply”) chosen by the parties to the Refugee Convention unequivocally supports the view that all a subscribing country can consider in determining whether a claimant is excluded under Article 1F(b) is whether the claimant committed a serious crime outside the country of refuge prior to applying for refugee status there. Nothing in the words used suggests that the parties to the Refugee Convention intended subsequent considerations, like rehabilitation, expiation and actual dangerousness, to be taken into account.” Then at [54] the Supreme Court of Canada stated, “… Article 1F(b) is aimed at excluding from refugee status persons who have committed a serious crime, regardless of what may have happened since.” The above extract followed an assessment by the majority of the Canadian Supreme Court of the CJEU’s decision in Germany v B and D C-57/09, C-101/09, [2010] ECR I-10979. The CJEU stated, albeit by reference to the Qualification Directive and not Article 1F(b) directly, “106. By its third question in each of the cases, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht asks whether exclusion from refugee status pursuant to Article12(2)(b) or(c) of Directive 2004/83 is conditional upon a proportionality test being undertaken in relation to the particular case. 107. In that regard, it should be borne in mind that it is clear from the wording of Article12(2) of Directive 2004/83 that, if the conditions laid down therein are met, the person concerned ‘is excluded’ from refugee status and that, within the system of the directive, Article2(c) expressly makes the status of ‘refugee’ conditional upon the fact that the person concerned does not fall within the scope of Article12. … 109. Since the competent authority has already, in its assessment of the seriousness of the acts committed by the person concerned and of that person’s individual responsibility, taken into account all the circumstances surrounding those acts and the situation of that person, it cannot — as the German, French, Netherlands and United Kingdom Governments have submitted — be required, if it reaches the conclusion that Article12(2) applies, to undertake an assessment of proportionality, implying as that does a fresh assessment of the level of seriousness of the acts committed. 110. It is important to note that the exclusion of a person from refugee status pursuant to Article12(2) of Directive 2004/83 does not imply the adoption of a position on the separate question of whether that person can be deported to his country of origin.” It is clear that the CJEU did not consider there was any requirement to undertake a proportionality assessment once the core elements of Article 12(2) were satisfied, which supports the respondent’s contention that there was no discretion available to the 2015 Panel. We are not persuaded, for the reasons given, that the 2015 Panel erred on a point of law by failing to exercise a discretion not to exclude KU from the Refugee Convention. NOTICE OF DECISION We are satisfied that the 2015 Panel did not make an error that requires its decision to be set aside. The appellants’ appeals are dismissed and the decision of the 2015 Panel stands. Signed Date 8 May 2019 UTJ Dawson Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson",2019-05-14

The appellant appeals with the permission of the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Callow dismissing his appeal against a decision of the respondent, dated 17 October 2018, refusing his protection claim.2. The appellant is a Kurdish Alevi citizen of Turkey. He arrived in the UK on 21 August 2017 and claimed asylum the same day. He gave an account to the respondent of having been involved with the HDP since 2015. He became a member in July 2016. He used to distribute leaflets and encourage people to join protests. On 6 November 2016 he was arrested during a protest and detained for two days. He was released due to lack of evidence. He was detained a second time on 25 July 2017 as he left the HDP office in Istanbul. On this occasion he was threatened with death and accused of being a member of the PKK. He was ordered to become an informer. However, the appellant left Turkey.3. The respondent rejected the claim. It was accepted that the appellant was a low-level supporter of the HDP as he claimed. However, his account of being detained and beaten by the Turkish authorities was rejected despite medical evidence being produced confirming he had injuries.4. The appellant appealed on protection grounds and his appeal was heard by Judge Callow on 22 November 2018 at Taylor House. The judge's findings begin at paragraph 29 of his decision. He reasoned that the core of the appellant's claim, whereby he agreed to become an informer in the absence of any incriminating evidence against him and in circumstances where no charges had been preferred, did not make sense. If the authorities believed he supported the PKK, he would not have been a person whom they would trust. 5. The judge inferred the appellant was not of any interest to the authorities. He noted the appellant's account of his political activities for the HDP was insubstantial and in circumstances where his knowledge of the PKK was limited. He considered there was no suggestion that those activities were illegal or clandestine. The demonstrations which the appellant participated in were mass group activities organised by others. The appellant, as a low-level member of the HDP, would hardly have been a useful source of information for the authorities. He held no office in the party. 6. The judge noted by way of background that the HDP is represented in the Turkish parliament and therefore the appellant's evidence that it was an offence to be a member defied belief. 7. The judge noted that the appellant's scars had been assessed as consistent with his account of ill-treatment. However, the judge reasoned, had the appellant been tortured to the extent he claimed, it could reasonably be expected that he would have sustained long-lasting injuries. In any event, these injuries could have been caused by means other than assault by the authorities. 8. In conclusion, the judge accepted the appellant was a member of the HDP but not that the events which the appellant says led him to leave Turkey had been established. He concluded the appellant had fabricated his claim.9. Four grounds were advanced in support of the application for permission to appeal against Judge Callow's decision and permission to appeal has been granted to argue all of them. 10. No rule 24 response has been filed by the respondent. 11. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether Judge Callow made an error of law in her decision. 12. Ms Panagiotopoulou's submissions broadly followed her grounds seeking permission to appeal. 13. Firstly, she argued the judge had failed to give adequate reasons for some of his findings. In particular, she highlighted the statement in paragraph 33 of the decision where the judge stated that the appellant had been generally unreliable as a witness without at that point providing any reasons. Ms Panagiotopoulou also highlighted paragraph 34 in which judge considered the appellant's injuries would have been more long-lasting. The grounds point out that the medical report of Dr Hajioff described the appellant's scars in detail and considered they were consistent with the account of the appellant's ill-treatment.14. Secondly, Ms Panagiotopoulou argued the judge's approach to the background evidence was erroneous. The judge's conclusion that a low-level member of the HDP would not have attracted the adverse attention of the authorities was inconsistent with the background evidence which showed that, despite the HDP being a legal party with 67 seats in Parliament, members and supporters have been disproportionately targeted by the authorities due to the perceived link between the HDP and the PKK. There was evidence before the judge showing that thousands of HDP militants and supporters were currently in custody.15. Thirdly, Ms Panagiotopoulou argued the judge had made inconsistent findings. The judge had apparently accepted that the appellant was a member of the HDP, had distributed leaflets and participated in demonstrations and that he had been arrested and injured. However, in paragraph 36, the judge concluded the appellant had fabricated his claim of political activity and adverse attention.16. Fourthly and finally, Ms Panagiotopoulou argued the judge had placed undue weight on peripheral matters and the lack of supporting evidence from his parents and sisters.17. In reply, Ms Everett acknowledged she had a concern about paragraph 33 of the decision because she could not find any reference in the evidence to the appellant claiming that it was an offence to be a member of the HDP. She also agreed that it was unclear which parts of the appellant's political activities the judge was referring to in paragraph 36. She agreed with Ms Panagiotopoulou that the judge's conclusions about risk on return were speculative to the extent they did not recognise that what was important was the perception of the authorities, not the appellant's actual knowledge of political parties and his usefulness as an informer. In terms, Ms Everett agreed with Ms Panagiotopoulou that the decision should be set aside.18. I do not agree with all the grounds. For example, the judge was entitled to apply the principle in TK (Burundi) and draw an adverse inference from the absence of evidence which it could reasonably be expected would be provided and which it would not be difficult to obtain. I also consider he showed sufficient familiarity with the background evidence because he referred to it at paragraphs 12, 20 and 30. His findings and conclusions were not outside the range of outcomes which would be consistent with that evidence. 19. However, I find the judge did fall into material error as a result of his finding in paragraph 36 that, ""the appellant's account of political activity and of adverse interest in him by the authorities is not credible. I find that the appellant has fabricated his claim"". Whilst this is clearly an attempt by the judge to summarise his main conclusions, the problem with it is that it is not clear from the rest of the decision which parts of the appellant's account of his political activity he did not accept. 20. The judge accepted at paragraph 35 that the appellant was a member of the HDP, whereas the respondent only accepted that he was a low-level supporter. The distinction between member and supporter might have been an inadvertent slip of the pen which would not amount to a material error. However, the reader does not know what it is the judge did not accept about the claim. The discussion of the appellant's activities in paragraph 32 is in the context of the assessment of the report of Dr Hajioff. There are no clear adverse findings and at least some parts of the claim to have distributed leaflets and participated in demonstrations appear to have been accepted. The judge was provided with some photographs of the appellant engaging in political activities. 21. Clearly, it is necessary to make clear findings as to the extent of the appellant's activities in order to be able to make a safe assessment of the risk on return. I consider the judge's failure to do so led to material error rendering the decision unsafe.22. I am also troubled by paragraph 33, where the judge states, ""? given the appellant's general unreliability as a witness and because he left Turkey with an ID card, there is no good reason to suggest that he did so illegally. His assertion, in circumstances where his party has representation in parliament that it was an offence to be a member of the HDP, defies belief."" 23. The representatives were both unaware of any record of the appellant claiming that membership of the HDP was an offence. I was not invited to read the judge's handwritten notes of the evidence in his record of the proceedings given Ms Panagiotopoulou had represented the appellant in the First-tier Tribunal. 24. If the appellant had made that claim in defiance of the obvious fact that the HDP is not proscribed, it could conceivably have been a relevant factor in the judge's credibility assessment. However, absent other clear reasons, it is not possible to understand why the judge found the appellant's evidence was generally unreliable. Further explanation is required.25. The appellant's appeal is allowed to the extent the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The outcome of the appeal on its merits remains unresolved. Clear findings of fact must be made on key aspects of the claim in order for the risk on return to be assessed safely. There are no preserved findings. 26. Having considered the Senior President's Practice Direction of 15 September 2012, I make an order under section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. NOTICE OF DECISION The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of law and his decision dismissing the appeal is set aside.

Representation:For the appellant: Mr I. Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer For the respondent: Ms A. Harvey instructed by Cranbrook SolicitorsDECISION AND REASONS1. For the sake of continuity, I shall continue to refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal although technically the Secretary of State is the appellant in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal. 2. The appellant (SH) appealed the respondent's (SSHD) decision dated 29 June 2018 to refuse a protection and human rights claim. 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert (""the judge"") allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 03 September 2018. 4. The Secretary of State appeals the First-tier Tribunal decision on the ground of procedural unfairness. The Secretary of State relied on a quote from a post-hearing note by the Home Office Presenting Officer, which alleged that the judge made comments and asked questions during the hearing which indicated that he was bias against the respondent's case. He did not allow questioning as to how one of the witnesses obtained his status in the UK. The Presenting Officer asserted that the judge's conduct ""lacked impartiality, professionalism and started commenting and laughing with the Applnt counsel"". The respondent relied on the decision in Sivapatham (Appearance of Bias) [2017] UKUT 00293. Decision and reasons5. Having considered the ground of appeal and submissions made by both parties I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an error on a point of law. 6. The burden is on the Secretary of State to show that a fair-minded observer, having considered the facts, would concluded that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was bias: see Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67. 7. Apart from the section quoted in the grounds there is no witness statement from the Presenting Officer who was present at the hearing. No copy of the original note has been produced. The only evidence before the Tribunal is a summary of her file note in the text of the grounds of appeal. 8. In contrast, the appellant has produced a witness statement from counsel who attended the hearing and a copy of his contemporaneous notes and a witness statement from the solicitor who attended the hearing and a copy of his attendance note. The judge has also produced a note in response to the allegations. The picture provided by those witnesses does not support the allegations made about the judge's conduct. 9. The evidence is consistent in stating that the judge limited questioning on one particular area, but the circumstances do not indicate that this was done unfairly. A judge is entitled to control the evidence and the questioning if he considers that it is not material to the issues that need to be determined in the appeal. It was within a range of reasonable responses for the judge to find that it was not necessary to question the supporting witness about his own immigration history and how he came to be granted leave to remain. 10. Clearly the Presenting Officer was not happy when the judge stopped her from pursuing a line of questioning that she thought was relevant, but in the absence of anything more, and in light of the dearth of evidence from the Presenting Officer herself, any tensions at the hearing between the Presenting Officer and the judge are not elevated to a potential error of law. There is no challenge to the other findings made by the judge, which were open to him to make on the evidence. 11. I conclude that the weight of the evidence does not show that a fair-minded observer, having considered all the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the Tribunal was bias.

The appellant appeals with the permission of the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal I D Boyes dismissing his appeal against a decision of the respondent, dated 21 May 2018, refusing his protection claim.2. The appellant is a citizen of India. He arrived in the UK in October 2009 in order to study. He was refused an extension of stay as a student in 2011 and, having failed in a further attempt to obtain leave, on 6 October 2017 was arrested and detained by the police on the basis he was considered to be an overstayer. In due course he claimed asylum. 3. The appellant claimed that his father had borrowed a large sum of money from a Mr [ST], who was now a minister. In around October 2007 he demanded the deeds to the appellant's father's land on the basis that, when the debt was repaid, he would return them. The appellant claimed he was attacked in December 2007 by people demanding he should transfer the land into their names. The appellant's father transferred the land to the appellant in 2008.4. Additionally, the appellant claimed that, in 2006, he was arrested and tortured by the police while demonstrating in Amritsar. He was detained for three days. During that time, he claimed he was tortured.5. The respondent refused the appellant's protection claim because the appellant's account was not considered credible. The lateness of the claim was prominent in the respondent's consideration. The appellant's appeal was heard by the judge at Newport on 5 July 2018 and dismissed in a decision promulgated on 11 July 2018. 6. In a brief decision, the judge found he was not satisfied the appellant was at any risk in relation to the land dispute with Mr [T]. There was no evidence of the transaction, of Mr [T], of the land being seized or of threats being made to the appellant. In any event, even if the matter were true, the appellant could obtain help from the police and/or relocate to another part of India. Regarding the political claim, the judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's decision to join a party in February 2018, which was after his arrest and asylum claim, did not evince a genuine political belief. The appellant had seemingly joined the organisation to bolster his claim. In any event, the party was not one which was outlawed or banned and there was no evidence that mere membership of the party in the UK or indeed India would put a person in peril. The judge rejected the claim that the appellant had been arrested and tortured for his political beliefs. There was a rule 35 report highlighting a number of injuries but these could have been incurred in a variety of ways. He found the lateness of the claim hugely undermined the appellant's credibility.7. The judge considered separately whether removing the appellant would breach his human rights on account of his mental health problems. He found it would not because there would be proper and sufficient treatment available for him in India. Finally, the judge found there were no significant obstacles to the appellant's integration in India.8. Very brief ground seeking permission to appeal were submitted. Permission to appeal was nonetheless granted because it was considered arguable that the judge's treatment of the medical evidence was superficial. It was considered arguable the judge had not considered humanitarian protection and had given inadequate consideration to articles 3 and 8 of the Human Rights Convention. It was considered arguable the judge's approach to the fact-finding exercise was inadequate.9. The respondent has not filed a rule 24 response.10. The appellant is not legally represented and he did not attend the hearing. I checked that a notice of hearing had been sent to his last known address in Birmingham. This gave the appellant sufficient notice of the hearing. The notice has not been returned undelivered and I can safely assume it was received. The procedure rules permit the hearing to go ahead in the appellant's absence if I am satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to notify a party of the hearing and it is in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing. I was satisfied on both points. There was no reason to adjourn. There is mention in the papers of the appellant suffering from ill-health but there was no evidence before me to show he was unfit to attend the hearing. 11. Ms Everett submitted the decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any material error of law. I agree and I dismiss the appellant's appeal. My reasons are as follows. 12. The judge was plainly right to note that the land dispute did not provide the appellant with a Refugee Convention reason. 13. The judge considered the evidence that the appellant had been able to provide in support of his claim and he was entitled to find it lacking such that the burden of proof was not discharged even to the lower standard applicable. 14. When, in paragraph 19, the judge expressed himself in terms that ""no evidence"" had been provided in respect of various matters, he must be understood as meaning no supporting or documentary evidence had been provided. His decision that the appellant could seek the protection of the police does not address the claim by the appellant that Mr [T] is a minister. However, it is clear that no evidence was submitted supporting that claim and the decision is best understood as meaning the judge was not prepared to accept the appellant's assertion without more.15. I find no material error of law in the judge's consideration of the land dispute claim.16. Regarding the other limb of the appellant's protection claim, concerning his political activities, the judge considered the two highpoints of the evidence, which were his joining a political party in the UK and the rule 35 report. He was entitled to find that none of this was capable of overcoming the doubts sewn by the lateness of the claim, which the appellant only made after his arrest, or his failure to mention being arrested and tortured in the screening interview. 17. The judge was entitled to find that the appellant's decision to join the party in February 2018 was to bolster the claim made in November 2017, some eight years after he arrived in the UK and six years after his last period of leave expired. The judge also noted, in paragraph 22, that the appellant had not established that membership of the party he joined would place him at risk on return. 18. The medical evidence consisted of nothing more than a rule 35 report, which is not independent evidence of torture. As the judge noted, if the use of the term ""consistent"" were to be interpreted according to the Istanbul Protocol categorisation, at best the report showed the appellant's injuries could have been caused in a number of ways.19. The medical evidence did not entitle the judge to find a breach of article 3 as a consequence of removing the appellant to India where treatment would be available for his mental health problems. I see no material error in the decision.20. I do not see on what other basis this appellant might be entitled to a grant of humanitarian protection. 21. Finally, with regard to article 8, as with all parts of the decision, the judge's reasoning extremely concise. However, I cannot see any material error given there seems to have been no reliable basis put forward on which the appellant could have met the rules on private or family life grounds and there would seem to be no exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of leave outside the rules.

This is a remade decision of an appeal against the respondent's decision dated 31 May 2017 refusing the appellant's Article 8 human rights claim. In a decision promulgated on 23 May 2018 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J Bartlett (the FtJ) dismissed the appellant's appeal. In an 'error of law' decision promulgated on 5 December 2018 I found that the FtJ's decision contained errors on points of law that required it to be set aside. A copy of the 'error of law' decision is included in an appendix to this decision.2. The identified errors of law related to the application of the 'very compelling circumstances' threshold in s117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act). I briefly summarise the errors of law. (a) Although the FtJ was entitled to conclude that the individual periods of delay by the respondent in the deportation process did not reflect a lack of interest in deporting the appellant, and although the FtJ was entitled to conclude that the public interest was not thereby diminished, she failed to consider whether the cumulative effect of the delays was such as to contribute to the establishment of very compelling circumstances. (b) The FtJ misdirected herself in holding that the appellant was not financially independent because he was supported by LN (his wife) and actively holding this against him (Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58). (c) When determining whether there existed 'very compelling circumstances' it was not apparent that the FtJ took into account the circumstances in which the appellant came to the UK as a 13 year old, or her finding that the appellant experienced a ""traumatic time at the hands of his supposed guardian"" and that it was in this context that he committed crimes and got involved in a gang.(d) When determining whether there existed 'very compelling circumstances' the FtJ failed to take express account of the significant efforts undertaken by the appellant to turn his life around or his length of residence in the UK. 3. The factual findings of the FtJ were unaffected by the errors of law and were retained. As a consequence the central issue for resolution is whether there are 'very compelling circumstances' rendering the appellant's deportation disproportionate under Article 8, by reference to s.117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act). Summary of chronological and procedural background and retained factual findings4. The appellant, a national of Nigeria, was born in 1990. He lived with his family in Nigeria until he was 13 years old. For reasons unclear his parents arranged for the appellant to go to the UK with a relative stranger in 2003. Although he claims to have entered the UK pursuant to an entry clearance issued to him as the dependent of a ""guardian"" there is no official record of his entry to the UK. He has never had lawful leave to enter or remain.5. The appellant maintained contact with his family in Nigeria to varying degree throughout the years. The FtJ found that the appellant had retained family and cultural connections to Nigeria and that his Nigerian family could assist him and his family in the UK if they relocated to Nigeria.6. The appellant was physically and verbally abused and neglected by his supposedly 'guardian' in the UK. In his statement he explained that he would avoid her as much as possible and that she made him feel as if there was something wrong with him. The appellant only began to attend school in 2005 and obtained some GCSEs. As a result of the neglect and abuse to which he was subjected, and his lack of family support, the appellant became embroiled with gangs and criminality. He described in detail in his statement how he became associated with individuals in a ""smoking house"" and how he began to consider these people as his ""new family"" and began living with them. He began to smoke a lot of cannabis and would steal to purchase the drug.7. The appellant received a six-month Supervision Order for having a blade with a sharp point in a public place in February 2008. On 11 March 2011 he was convicted of 2 counts of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply and received a 30-month sentence of imprisonment. He made an asylum claim in May 2011 but accepts that this claim was without foundation. The asylum claim was withdrawn in a letter written by the appellant's solicitors in February 2014. When lodging his asylum claim the appellant also claimed to be a victim of human trafficking. This claim was ultimately rejected by the Competent Authority in a decision dated 12 September 2012. There was no legal challenge to this decision. In my 'error of law' decision I rejected Mr Southey's submission that the FtJ erred in law by failing to consider whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking (see paragraph 36 of the 'error of law' decision).8. The appellant met LN, a British citizen, in 2007 and they entered into a relationship in September 2009. They have a son, NN, born on 8 May 2013. The appellant and LN married on 12 October 2013. A further child, LON, was born on 13 October 2018. The appellant told LN about his immigration status about halfway through his 2011 prison sentence.9. The appellant was released on licence on 25 June 2012. A deportation order was served on him on 11 September 2013 but was withdrawn on 14 October 2014 at an appeal hearing as it had not been signed. The case remitted to the respondent for further consideration. On 23 January 2016 the appellant was served with a lawful notice of decision to deport him and, on 22 February 2016, his representatives made further submissions in response to this decision. The respondent treated these further representations as a human rights claim and refused the human rights claim on 31 May 2017. The appeal of this decision was heard on 30 April 2018.10. The FtJ found that the appellant did not represent a danger to the community and did not consequently uphold a certification issued under section 72 of the 2002 Act. In reaching this conclusion the FtJ noted that the appellant had not engaged in criminal conduct since his sentencing in 2011 and that he had changed his life such that he posed a low risk of reoffending. The FtJ found the appellant to be ""a different person to the individual who committed the crimes in 2008 and 2011."" The FtJ found the evidence about the appellant's personal growth due to the support provided by LN and her family to be ""compelling"". The FtJ accepted that the appellant spent his time in prison busy working and studying to obtain qualifications. The FtJ noted the appellant's evidence that, during his prison term, he carried out numerous courses which included drugs and alcohol awareness, obtained hygiene certificates, and undertook A-level maths. The FtJ noted that the appellant was studying for an accounting qualification (which he has now obtained), that if he had permission to work in the UK he would do so, that he was ambitious for a better life and wished to be a role model for his son, that he was the primary carer for his son and a committed father, and that he drank limited alcohol infrequently and did not have an alcohol problem. It was for these reasons that the appellant was found to be at low risk of offending. 11. The FtJ noted that NN was 4 years old at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing (at the date of the hearing to remake the decision NN was a few days shy of his 6th birthday) and had spent his entire life in the care of his mother and father. Although the FtJ accepted that LN was the breadwinner in the family she did not accept that LN worked for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. The FtJ found that the appellant was genuinely a loving father and that his son would be distraught if separated from him. The FtJ concluded that it would be in NN's best interests to remain living with his mother and father as a family unit in the UK to enable him to benefit from his rights as a British citizen. In my 'error of law' decision I rejected Mr Southey's submission that the FtJ failed to undertake an adequate assessment of NN's best interests and found that she lawfully engaged with and took into account reports by an Independent Social Worker (ISW). 12. The FtJ did not find that the effect of deportation on NN would be unduly harsh and, at the 'error of law' hearing, Mr Southey abandoned a ground that argued that the FtJ erred in her approach to the harshness of the situation faced by NN. In finding that it would not be unduly harsh for NN to live in Nigeria the FtJ took into account LN's evidence that she did not want NN to live there, and her concerns regarding safety and sanitation, and took into account the ISW's reports. The FtJ summarised the ISW's description of the appellant's relationships with his wife and son and noted that the ISW's identified concerns ""? would be applicable to all healthy for-year-olds."" The FtJ commented that the ISW's reports contained very few specific findings relating to NN's relocation to Nigeria and that it made general observations about how children seen as different would have difficulties. The FtJ found that, at least initially, NN would be able to live with his grandparents and extended family, that he had some familiarity with his grandmother and aunt, and that there was an education system and a health system in Nigeria. The FtJ additionally noted NN's age and the stage of his education, and that his focus was on his immediate family rather than the wider community. The FtJ accepted that Nigeria was not a developed country, that not all of Nigeria had a reliable electricity supply or running water, and that the lifestyle in Nigeria would be of a lower standard than that available in the UK. The FtJ also accepted that NN would suffer a culture shock if he were to move to Nigeria but that he was still relatively young and would have the assistance of his father and extended family. Whilst accepting that any notional move to Nigeria would be ""? undesirable, uncomfortable, difficult, challenging and unwanted"", the FtJ did not find this would amount to undue harshness.13. In finding that it would not be unduly harsh for NN to remain in the UK without the appellant the FtJ referred to the evidence of the distress this would cause NN and LN and, with reference to the ISW's report, that this would have a damaging effect on both. The FtJ accepted that if the appellant were deported and NN remained in the UK in the care of his mother it would have a damaging effect on both NN and LN and that they would suffer emotionally. The FtJ also accepted that LN was suffering from stress and anxiety and that she had some mental ill-health concerns arising from the threat of the appellant's deportation. There was however limited evidence to suggest that this was so serious as to require specialist treatment and/or counselling. The FtJ found that, if the appellant was deported, NN would be in the care of his mother who was a committed and loving parent and would also receive assistance from her family. The FtJ additionally noted that communication with the appellant would not be severed.14. The FtJ found that the appellant could not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 399A of the immigration rules, and the requirements of paragraph 399(b) of the immigration rules could not be satisfied as the appellant was unlawfully present in the UK when he formed his relationship with LN. The FtJ found that the appellant could not satisfy Exception 1 in s.117C(4) of the 2002 Act because he had not been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life. The FtJ found, with reference to s.117C(5), that the appellant's deportation would not have an unduly harsh impact on LN and supported this conclusion with reasons that included the support that LN would receive from the appellant and his family if she went to Nigeria and her own resourcefulness, and the support she would receive in the UK from her own family if she decided to remain in this country. Documents that have been considered15. The appellant continues to rely on the 3 core bundles (Bundles A to C) that were filed with the First-tier Tribunal, and the further documents served on the day of the First-tier Tribunal hearing. I have considered these documents in reaching my decision. The documents included, inter alia, a 68-page statement from the appellant running to 147 paragraphs and dated 12 September 2014, a further statement dated 14 April 2018, a 29-page statement from LN dated 15 August 2014, and a further statement from her dated 18 April 2018. The bundles additionally included statements from members of LN's family, an ISW report authored by Peter Horrocks dated 15 September 2014 and an updating report dated 28 December 2017, a Pre-Sentence Report dated 8 March 2011, an OASys Assessment dated 12 August 2014, copies of various certificates and qualifications obtained by the appellant, and various evidence of the nature and quality of the appellant's relationship with his son and partner. The bundles also contained background information on Nigeria, documents relating to a cleaning company established by LN, and a letter from NN's primary school. I have additionally considered further evidence adduced by the appellant including records relating to LN's treatment with Talking Therapies, confirmation of the birth and nationality of the appellant's 2nd child, an ATT Foundation Certificate in Accounting - Level 2 awarded to the appellant on 17 October 2018, a letter from Juan Pimienta, Chair of the Metropolitan Police Ibero-American Association dated 29 April 2019, and photographs of the appellant attending a book launch discussion in April 2019, and of his attendance at a Community Council Question Time in the same month to discuss knife crime. There was no new documentary evidence relating to NN. 16. At the hearing to remake the decision Mr Southey indicated that he would not be calling the appellant or any witnesses to give oral evidence. I maintained a record of the submissions made by both representatives and have carefully considered those submissions. The proceedings in the Upper Tribunal and the submissions made are, in any event, a matter of record. Mr Southey's essential submission was that a holistic assessment of all relevant factors, which included the impact of the deportation on the family unit, the circumstances by which the appellant came to be in the UK as a 13-year-old, the abuse to which he was subjected and which led to his criminality, the powerful steps he took to rehabilitate himself and his 'pro-social' conduct, and the consequences of the respondent's delays, reached the 'very compelling circumstances' threshold such that the refusal of his human rights claim would be disproportionate under Article 8. Legal Framework17. Section 117A of the 2002 Act requires a Tribunal, when considering the public interest question, to have regard, in particular, to the factors listed in section 117B, and, in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C. 18. Section 117B reads,117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest.(2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-(a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and(b) are better able to integrate into society.(3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent, because such persons-(a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and(b) are better able to integrate into society.(4) Little weight should be given to-(a) a private life, or(b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.(5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public interest does not require the person's removal where-(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and(b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.19. Section 117C lists additional public interest considerations in cases involving foreign criminals. (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.(2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.(3) In the case of a foreign criminal (""C"") who has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.(4) Exception 1 applies where-(a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of C's life,(b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and(c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.(5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.(6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.(7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been convicted.20. Although s.117C(3) does not make any provision for medium offenders who fall outside Exceptions 1 and 2 the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662 confirmed that Parliament intended medium offenders to have the same fall back protection as serious offenders.21. In Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803, Sales LJ stated, at [45], (a point undisturbed on appeal to the Supreme Court)""It is common ground that the starting point for consideration of the proper construction of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of Article 8 which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with, and not in violation of, Article 8. In that regard, both sides affirmed the approach to interpretation of Part 5A to ensure compliance with Article 8 as explained by this court in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662, in particular at [26] and [31].""22. Then at [49] and [50] Sales LJ held, ""? Section 117A(2) does not have the effect that, for example, a court or tribunal has a discretion to say that the maintenance of effective immigration control is not in the public interest, in direct contradiction of the statement of public policy by Parliament in section 117B(1). Where Parliament has itself declared that something is in the public interest - see sections 117B(1), (2), (3) and section 117C(1) - that is definitive as to that aspect of the public interest. But it should be noted that having regard to such considerations does not mandate any particular outcome in an article 8 balancing exercise: a court or tribunal has to take these considerations into account and give them considerable weight, as is appropriate for a definitive statement by Parliament about a particular aspect of the public interest, but they are in principle capable of being outweighed by other relevant considerations which may make it disproportionate under article 8 for an individual to be removed from the UK.Another type of consideration identified in Part 5A to which regard must be had under section 117A(2) is the statement in section 117C(6) that 'the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2' (my emphasis). There is a similar requirement in section 117C(3), on its proper construction: see NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department at [23]-[27]. In these provisions, Parliament has actually specified what the outcome should be of a structured consideration of Article 8 in relation to foreign criminals as set out in section 117C, namely that under the conditions identified there the public interest requires deportation. The 'very compelling circumstances' test in section 117C(3) and (6) provides a safety valve, with an appropriately high threshold of application, for those exceptional cases involving foreign criminals in which the private and family life considerations are so strong that it would be disproportionate and in violation of Article 8 to remove them. If, after working through the decision-making framework in section 117C, a court or tribunal concludes that it is a case in which section 117C(3) or (6) says that the public interest 'requires' deportation, it is not open to the court or tribunal to deny this and to hold that the public interest does not require deportation.""23. In NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 239, considered after Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60, Sir Stephen Richards, stated, at [14] and [15]""? I see no reason to doubt what was common ground in Rhuppiah and was drawn from NA (Pakistan), that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of Article 8 which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with Article 8. In particular, if in working through the structured approach one gets to section 117C(6), the proper application of that provision produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in all cases to which it applies. The provision contains more than a statement of policy to which regard must be had as a relevant consideration. Parliament's assessment that ""the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"" is one to which the tribunal is bound by law to give effect.None of this is problematic for the proper application of Article 8. That a requirement of ""very compelling circumstances"" in order to outweigh the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals sentenced to at least four years' imprisonment is compatible with Article 8 was accepted in MF (Nigeria) and in Hesham Ali itself. Of course, the provision to that effect in section 117C(6) must not be applied as if it contained some abstract statutory formula. The context is that of the balancing exercise under Article 8, and the ""very compelling circumstances"" required are circumstances sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in the deportation of the foreign criminals concerned. Provided that a tribunal has that context in mind, however, a finding that ""very compelling circumstances"" do not exist in a case to which section 117C(6) applies will produce a final result, compatible with Article 8, that the public interest requires deportation. There is no room for any additional element in the proportionality balancing exercise under Article 8.""24. When determining the existence of 'very compelling circumstances' the appellant is entitled to rely on matters identified in Exception 1 and 2 in s.117C, but he needs to point to features of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2, or features falling outside the circumstances described in those Exceptions which makes his claim based on Article 8 especially strong (NA (Pakistan), at [25] to [29]; RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 00123 (IAC), at [20]). 25. In the Court of Appeal decision in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58 (as quoted above at paragraph 21 of this decision) Sales LJ referred to the ""appropriately high threshold of application"" for the 'very compelling circumstances' test. This chimes with what was said in Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60 (at [38]) that 'very compelling circumstances' means ""a very strong claim indeed."" In NA (Pakistan) Jackson LJ held, at [33] and [34]""Although there is no 'exceptionality' requirement, it inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in which circumstances are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the high public interest in deportation will be rare. The commonplace incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in poor health or the natural love between parents and children, will not be sufficient.The best interests of children certainly carry great weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic [2013] 1 AC 338 at [145]. Nevertheless, it is a consequence of criminal conduct that offenders may be separated from their children for many years, contrary to the best interests of those children. The desirability of children being with both parents is a commonplace of family life. That is not usually a sufficiently compelling circumstance to outweigh the high public interest in deporting foreign criminals.""26. In RA (Iraq), a decision of the President of the Upper Tribunal (IAC), the test in s.117C(6) was described as ""very demanding.""""? The fact that, at this point, a tribunal is required to engage in a wide-ranging proportionality exercise, balancing the weight that appropriately falls to be given to factors on the proposed deportee's side of the balance against the weight of the public interest, does not in any sense permit the tribunal to engage in the sort of exercise that would be appropriate in the case of someone who is not within the ambit of section 117C. Not only must regard be had to the factors set out in section 117B, such as giving little weight to a relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is established when the proposed deportee was in the United Kingdom unlawfully, the public interest in the deportation of a foreign criminal is high; and even higher for a person sentenced to imprisonment of at least four years.""27. In RA (Iraq) and MS (s.117C(6): ""very compelling circumstances"") Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC), both of which analysed KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53, it was held that, in determining whether there are very compelling circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2, a Tribunal will need to have regard to the seriousness of the offence and will need to engage in a wide-ranging evaluative exercise.28. In assessing the existence of very compelling circumstances I have applied the legal principles outlined above. I will now consider whether, holistically assessed, there exist 'very compelling circumstances'.Assessment 29. The index offence leading to the making of the deportation order involved 2 counts of possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine. According to the Sentencing Remarks the appellant was arrested with a significant amount of money on his person and in possession of mobile phones. The Sentencing Judge found that the appellant was fully involved in the supply of drugs to others and was ""an important link in the chain, whatever the position."" The Sentencing Judge made brief reference to the appellant's offence relating to possession of a bladed article in 2008 as this showed a willingness for the appellant to arm himself with a weapon with a for his defence not. The Sentencing Judge found that the index offences represented a significant escalation in the appellant's offending. The Sentencing judge accepted that the appellant had pleaded guilty and this reduced the sentence he would otherwise have received by a third. By way of mitigation the Sentencing Judge referred to the appellant's personal circumstances, noting that he had ""?not had the best of starts in life"" and that it was ""a tragedy"" in the appellant's case particularly because he had the intelligence to do well. Having taken account of the appellant's age and what he had accomplished on remand, the Sentencing Judge considered it appropriate to sentence the appellant to 2 years and 6 months detention in a young offender institution.30. While the sentence of 30 months detention is approximately mid-way in the intermediate level (between 12 months and 4 years), a conviction for the supply of class A drugs is a serious matter, capable of affecting many individuals and society in general.31. In assessing the weight of the public interest I take addition account of the principle of general deterrence (see MS (s.117C(6): ""very compelling circumstances"") Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC), at [49] to [52]). I do not hold against the appellant the public interest factors in s.117B(2) & (3). In the appellant's case these are neutral factors. I also attach weight to the public interest in the maintenance of immigration control, noting however that, while the appellant has never had any leave to enter or remain, he entered as a minor and cannot be blamed for his lack of lawful leave. The appellant's relationship with LS commenced when he was 20 years old and, applying s.117B(4), I must accordingly attach little weight to their relationship. 32. The appellant is at low risk of reoffending. I remind myself that the FtJ found the appellant to be ""a different person to the individual who committed the crimes in 2008 and 2011"", that he was ambitious for a better life and wished to be a role model for his son. 33. I have specifically considered the documentary evidence relating to the appellant's rehabilitation including, but not limited to, the Offender Manager letters from September and November 2013, the various certificates and qualifications obtained by the appellant both in prison and outside prison, and the appellant's involvement with Kids Company which provided him with outreach support, guidance and therapy.34. I take into account the letter written by the Chair of the Metropolitan Police Ibero-American Association dated 29 April 2019 and the May 2019 newsletter issued by the same organisation. I note the support provided by the appellant to the organisation and the Chair's view that the appellant ""? has proven himself to be one of the most talented and innovative young adults working to educate young people I have ever supervised. He has been an indispensable part of our team throughout the planning and preparation for our on-time release of the project."" I additionally note the Chair's opinion that the appellant would be an invaluable contributor to the fight against knife crime in London. I additionally take into account the letter from the Refugee Therapy Centre dated 28 February 2018 confirming the frequency of the appellant's psychotherapy sessions and that he was making gradual progress. I accept that the appellant has undertaken genuine efforts to rehabilitate himself, and that he is a reformed person, and that his present conduct suggests he is, in Mr Southey's words, 'pro-social'. 35. In RA (Iraq) the President of the Upper Tribunal (IAC) considered arguments relating to the issue of rehabilitation. At [32] and [33] he had this to say.""As the Court of Appeal pointed out in Danso v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 596, courses aimed at rehabilitation, undertaken whilst in prison, are often unlikely to bear material weight, for the simple reason that they are a commonplace; particularly in the case of sexual offenders.As a more general point, the fact that an individual has not committed further offences, since release from prison, is highly unlikely to have a material bearing, given that everyone is expected not to commit crime. Rehabilitation will therefore normally do no more than show that the individual has returned to the place where society expects him (and everyone else) to be. There is, in other words, no material weight which ordinarily falls to be given to rehabilitation in the proportionality balance (see SE (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 256, paragraphs 48 to 56). Nevertheless, as so often in the field of human rights, one cannot categorically say that rehabilitation will never be capable of playing a significant role (see LG (Colombia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1225). Any judicial departure from the norm would, however, need to be fully reasoned.""36. Mr Southey submitted that SE (Zimbabwe) was concerned with a situation where someone was still undergoing rehabilitation and whether the prospect of rehabilitation was relevant in the proportionality assessment. I accept that SE (Zimbabwe) was primarily concerned with someone who was undergoing continuing rehabilitation (see, in particular, [44] to [50]). Mr Southey also submitted that the Upper Tribunal's approach to rehabilitation focused on the absence of any further offences by an individual after their release from prison and did not specifically address other indicators of rehabilitation. I do not however consider that the Upper Tribunal focused only on the commission of further offences when considering rehabilitation. In observing that rehabilitation will ""? normally do no more than show that the individual has returned to the place where society expects him (and everyone else) to be"" the Tribunal can only realistically have had in mind a situation where a person's attitude and behaviour has changed such that there was no or little risk of any further offending. Although Danso was specifically concerned with a sex offender who had undertaken courses while in prison and who posed only a low risk of further violent re-offending, the Court of Appeal, in concluding that the Upper Tribunal did not err in attaching limited weight to the issue of rehabilitation, noted that there was nothing unusual in undergoing rehabilitative courses in prison that did significantly reduce the risk of re-offending. 37. On balance I do accept that the appellant has shown that he is a genuinely rehabilitated person, that he has demonstrated positive engagement in turning his life around (such as obtaining an accountancy qualification) and in making positive contributions to society (such as his role in the Metropolitan Police Ibero-American Association), and that he has rebuilt his life. I consider his rehabilitation against the circumstances in which he was brought to the UK and the traumatic experiences he underwent that led to his criminality in the first place. I note that he was released from immigration detention in July 2012 and that in a period approaching 7 years he has lived a law-abiding life. I find in these circumstances that rehabilitation does reduce the strength of the public interest and I attach appropriate weight to it.38. Mr Southey accepted that he might be in difficulty in seeking to persuade me that that 'very compelling circumstances' exist in reliance only on the impact of the deportation on the appellant's family life, but he submitted that such impact was a relevant factor when considered together with the other factors in issue. The appellant has established a strong family life with his wife and two children, and it is in the best interest of his children that he remains in the UK. the FtJ did not however find that his deportation would have an unduly harsh impact on his family in the UK. I have taken account of the evidence unavailable to the FtJ relating to LN's treatment with Talking Therapies. She attended what was generally a group guided self-help programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques that was to run for 6 weeks from March 2018. The records suggest LN was being treated for depression. There did not appear to be any risk of self-harm or harm to others, a protective factor included her son and her support system included her mother and the appellant. The records included a reference to LN's scores having improved, but her file was closed because she had missed or cancelled appointments. I do not find the new evidence materially alters the factual conclusions of the FtJ relating to the impact of the appellant's deportation on LN. I attach appropriate weight to the impact on the Article 8 rights of the appellant and his family in holistically assessing whether there are 'very compelling circumstances'.39. I note that the appellant has acted as the primary carer for NN, that the appellant is seen as a 'secure attachment figure' by NN, and that the appellant is supported by his wife. I take into account that LN relies on the appellant for childcare, and the FtJ's findings that NN would be distraught if the appellant were not part of the family unit. I accept that the appellant's immediate family is a close-knit one. I note that LN has indicated that she would not relocate to Nigeria. Given the background materials drawn to my attention at the remaking hearing (which included extracts from the 2016 US State Department Report relating to the difficulties faced by women and children in Nigeria and the substandard of education and health services) I accept Mr Southey's submission that LN's decision is a reasonable one. In assessing whether there are 'very compelling circumstances' I take full account of the serious impact the appellant's deportation would have on the family members, including LN's employment and health, the practical childcare difficulties that would arise, and the emotional impact on both LN, NN and LON. I additionally accept that a dismissal of the appellant's human rights claim may result in separation between a husband and his wife and children. There has not however been any suggestion that contact would be severed, either through remote forms of communication or through periodic visits. I take into account however that such forms of communication can never substitute for close personal interaction. 40. Mr Southey submits that the circumstances in which the appellant came to be in the UK, his age at the time, and the abuse he suffered, are all relevant factors to be considered 'in the round' when determining the existence of 'very compelling circumstances'. I agree with this submission, and his submission that these events act as mitigation in respect of the appellant's offending. Mr Clarke invited me to find that the Sentencing Judge had already considered the appellant's background and that this had been factored into the sentence. I accept that the Sentencing Judge did have regard to the appellant's background when deciding the appropriate sentence (see paragraph 29 above), but I have available to me more information's relating to the appellant's background than was available to the Probation Service and Sentencing Judge. Moreover, in SSHD v Barry [2018] EWCA Civ 790, a submission that a judge impermissibly took account of mitigation was rejected. At [57] Singh LJ stated,""I do not regard the approach of the FTT in this regard to have been impermissible as a matter of law. I do not agree that questions of mitigation are totally irrelevant to the balancing exercise which the FTT had to perform. Ms Patry is right to say that questions of mitigation will already have played their part in arriving at the appropriate sentence for the underlying offence. However, it must be borne in mind that the three categories which are set out in the Immigration Rules are broad categories. In particular, the most serious category applies to any offender who has been sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment of at least 4 years. However, that can cover a wide range of cases. Although they are all serious, they can vary in degrees of seriousness. The criminal courts in this country come across some examples of the most heinous kind, which would be towards the top end of the range envisaged by Category 1. However, in an appropriate case, I can see no reason in principle why either aggravating factors or mitigating factors might not be taken into account by the FTT in assessing the seriousness of the offence in question and, accordingly, the strength of the public interest in deportation. Similarly, in a case such as the present, which falls into the intermediate category of seriousness, because the sentence passed was between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment, I can see no reason in principle why aggravating or mitigating factors may not be taken into account by the FTT.""41. The appellant was a child when he entered the UK and would not have had any control over his circumstances. It has not been suggested by the respondent that the appellant entered the United Kingdom with the intention of breaching the immigration rules. I take this into account in my overall assessment. The FtJ accepted that the appellant experienced a traumatic time at the hands of his supposed guardian and that he found himself in a situation in which he did not have the skills to deal. I accept that the appellant found himself in a difficult situation where he had no control and that it was in this context that his criminality developed. I find that this does mitigate to some extent against his criminality and, as a consequence, against the public interest considerations in this particular case. It also explains his strong motivation for transforming his life through the stability provided by his immediate family. The appellant was nevertheless an adult when he committed his index offence and would have appreciated the seriousness of drug offending and the damage that it can cause. Nor does it follow that, because an individual has suffered trauma and abuse in childhood, they will commit criminal offences. Whilst I take full account of the circumstances that contributed to the appellant's criminality it was still something he chose to do, even if he felt he had limited options in life. 42. Mr Southey submits that the cumulative effect of delays by the respondent are relevant in respect of 2 of the 3 ways identified in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41. These were set out by Lord Bingham at [14] and [15].""14. It does not, however, follow that delay in the decision-making process is necessarily irrelevant to the decision. It may, depending on the facts, be relevant in any one of three ways. First, the applicant may during the period of any delay develop closer personal and social ties and establish deeper roots in the community than he could have shown earlier. The longer the period of the delay, the likelier this is to be true. To the extent that it is true, the applicant's claim under article 8 will necessarily be strengthened. It is unnecessary to elaborate this point since the respondent accepts it.15. Delay may be relevant in a second, less obvious, way. An immigrant without leave to enter or remain is in a very precarious situation, liable to be removed at any time. Any relationship into which such an applicant enters is likely to be, initially, tentative, being entered into under the shadow of severance by administrative order. This is the more true where the other party to the relationship is aware of the applicant's precarious position. This has been treated as relevant to the quality of the relationship. Thus in R (Ajoh) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] Immigration AR 817, para 11, it was noted that ""It was reasonable to expect that both [the applicant] and her husband would be aware of her precarious immigration status"". This reflects the Strasbourg court's listing of factors relevant to the proportionality of removing an immigrant convicted of crime: ""whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship"" see Boultif v Switzerland (2001) 33 EHRR 1179, para 48; Mokrani v France (2003) 40 EHRR 123, para 30. A relationship so entered into may well be imbued with a sense of impermanence. But if months pass without a decision to remove being made, and months become years, and year succeeds year, it is to be expected that this sense of impermanence will fade and the expectation will grow that if the authorities had intended to remove the applicant they would have taken steps to do so. This result depends on no legal doctrine but on an understanding of how, in some cases, minds may work and it may affect the proportionality of removal.""43. The appellant was informed on 14 April 2011 of his liability to deportation and he was released on licence on 25 June 2012 (although he remained in immigration detention until July 2012). The initial decision to deport him and the decision to refuse his asylum claim (made in May 2011) were not served on him until 11 September 2013, a delay of one year and 3 months since his release on licence and 2 years and 5 months since he was initially informed of his liability to deportation. Following the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on 14 October 2014 allowing his appeal on the basis that it was not in accordance with the law there was a further delay of one year and approximately 2 months before the respondent unlawfully attempted to remove the appellant on 21 December 2015 and then issued the new decision to deport him on 23 January 2016. The appellant made further representations on 22 February 2016, and the respondent responded to the submissions by refusing his human rights claim on 22 May 2017, a delay of one year and 3 months.44. In my 'error of law' decision I found no error in the FtJ's conclusion that the delays did not reflect a lack of interest by the respondent deporting the appellant, but that the delays were, when cumulatively considered, relatively significant in the context of a married man with a young child. Mr Southey submits that, as a result of the delays, the appellant is now in a stronger position to demonstrate that he is a changed man, and that he has fortified the strength of his article 8 relationships with his wife and through the birth of his 2 children. The sense of impermanence following the withdrawal of the first defective deportation decision lifted somewhat during the unaccountable delay in making a fresh deportation decision. Mr Southey drew my attention to paragraphs 57 and 58 of Uner v Netherlands (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 14, which built upon the earlier decision in Boultif (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 50, setting out relevant criteria when assessing whether an expulsion measure was necessary and proportionate under Article 8. These included the nature and seriousness of the offence committed, and the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant's conduct during that period.45. I accept that, through the 3 periods of delay identified above, the appellant has strengthened his Article 8 rights by marrying LN and having 2 children with her. The appellant however has never had lawful leave to remain in the UK and LN became aware of his lawful status before she married him. Whilst I do accept that it is necessary to consider the overall period of delay, each constituent period of delay was of a length not uncommon in this jurisdiction. The appellant knew he was liable to be deported from April 2011 and, but for the delay of approximately one year and 2 months before the 2nd signed deportation decision was issued, he and LN have always been aware of the respondent's intention to deport him. I nevertheless attach some weight to the respondent's overall delay which has placed the appellant in a stronger position than he otherwise would have occupied, and which has given him the opportunity to demonstrate that he is a changed man.Conclusion 46. I have not found this an easy decision to make, and this reflects the strong public interest considerations established by Parliament. In reaching my decision I have taken into account the caselaw of the ECrtHR including Uner and Boultif, and the relevant criteria identified in those cases. I have balanced the weight I can positively attribute to the Article 8 rights of the appellant and his family against the weight that must be accorded to the public interest. I remind myself that the test in s.117C(6) is extremely demanding. Despite the deleterious impact on the family life enjoyed by the appellant and his wife and children, considered together with his impressive actions in rehabilitating himself having suffered neglect and abuse since entering the UK, and considered together with the respondent's delays, I find there are no 'very compelling circumstances' over and above Exceptions 1 and 2 in s.117C such as to render the appellant's deportation disproportionate under Article 8. The appellant's index offence remains serious, as reflected in the length of his sentence, and the public interest in deterrence remains strong. I am not satisfied that the positive weight I have attached to the various factors weighing in the appellant's favour outweigh the strong public interest in his deportation. Given the factual findings by the FtJ LN and her two children will continue to have available to them support from their extended family in the UK, and the limited medical evidence provided suggests that suitable mechanisms are in place to support LN. for the reasons given above in my assessment from paragraphs 29 to 45, I am not satisfied that the high threshold for 'very compelling circumstances' has been met. Notice of DecisionThe appellant's human rights appeal is dismissedDirection Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant in this appeal is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.

Although no Anonymity Order was made by the First-tier Tribunal, and no application was made by the appellant's representative for an anonymity order, given that this appeal involves the appellant's relationship with a minor, I consider it appropriate to make an Anonymity Order. 2. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J Bartlett (the judge), promulgated on 23 May 2018, dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision dated 31 May 2017 refusing his Article 8 human rights claim.Background3. The appellant, a national of Nigeria, was born in 1990. He claims to have entered the UK in 2003 pursuant to an entry clearance issued to him as the dependent of a ""Guardian"". I have not however seen any confirmation of this grant of entry clearance. The appellant first came to the attention of the respondent in August 2004 when JT, a Portuguese national, applied for an EEA residence card with his spouse, FG, and her three children as his dependents. The appellant was identified as one of the children and there was a birth certificate purporting to confirm the relationship. The application was refused in 2005 as it was not accepted that JT was exercising Treaty rights. The SSHD noted the absence of an entry stamp in FG's passport and her marriage to JT was considered bogus.4. The appellant met LN, a British citizen, in 2007 and they entered into a relationship in September 2009. They have a son, NN, born on 8 May 2013. The appellant and LN married on 12 October 2013.5. The appellant received a six-month Supervision Order for having a blade with a sharp point in the public place in February 2008. On 11 March 2011 he was convicted of 2 counts of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply and received a 30-month sentence of imprisonment. He made an asylum claim in May 2011 but accepts that this claim was fraudulent. The asylum claim was withdrawn in a letter written by the appellant's solicitors in February 2014. When lodging his protection claim the appellant also claimed to be a victim of human trafficking. This claim was ultimately rejected by the Competent Authority in a decision dated 12 September 2012. There was no legal challenge to this decision.6. A deportation order was served on the appellant on 11 September 2013 but was withdrawn on 14 October 2014 at an appeal hearing as it had not been signed. The appellant's appeal was allowed on the basis that the decision was not in accordance with the law and the case remitted to the respondent for further consideration. On 23 January 2016 the appellant was served with a lawful notice of decision to deport him and, on 22 February 2016, his representatives made further submissions in response to this decision. The respondent treated these further representations as a human rights claim and refused the human rights claim on 31 May 2017. The appellant appealed this decision to the First-tier Tribunal pursuant to s.82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).The decision of the First-tier Tribunal 7. The judge had before her a significant number of documents contained in 3 bundles (Bundles A to C). There were further documents served on the day of the hearing. The documents included, inter alia, a 68-page statement from the appellant running to 147 paragraphs and dated 12 September 2014, a further statement dated 14 April 2018, a 29-page statement from LN dated 15 August 2014, and a further statement from her dated 18 April 2018. There were also statements from members of LN's family, an Independent Social Worker (ISW) report authored by Peter Horrocks dated 15 September 2014 and an updating report dated 28 December 2017, a Pre-Sentence Report dated 8 March 2011, an OASys Assessment dated 12 August 2014, copies of various certificates and qualifications obtained by the appellant, and various evidence of the nature and quality of the appellant's relationship with his son and partner. The bundles also contained background information on Nigeria, documents relating to a cleaning company established by LN, and a letter from NN's primary school.8. The judge indicated that the witness statements provided were some of the most detailed she had seen in this jurisdiction and that she gave them ""full consideration and read them carefully."" The judge set out the appellant's oral evidence which included further details of the circumstances of his offending, further details of his relationship with his partner, and details of his contact with his family in Nigeria. The judge also set out the oral evidence from LN (who was pregnant with their 2nd child), LN's sister AB, and LN's mother NM. The judge set out extracts from the ISW's reports and an extract from the Sentencing Judges remarks, and summarised the Reasons for Refusal Letter and the submissions made by both representatives.9. The judge accurately referred to the burden and standard of proof and set out the relevant provisions of the immigration rules relating to deportations, and sections 117A to D of the 2002 Act, relating to public interest considerations.10. In the section headed 'Decision' the judge indicated that she had considered all of the evidence ""in the round"" in coming to her decision even if it was not expressly referred to in her judgement. The judge found that the appellant did not represent a danger to the community and did not consequently uphold a certification issued under section 72 of the 2002 Act. In reaching this conclusion the judge noted that the appellant had not engaged in criminal conduct since his sentencing in 2011 and that he had changed his life such that he posed a low risk of reoffending.11. The judge appreciated that the question whether there was a breach of Article 8 involved a consideration of paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A of the immigration rules and section 117A-D of the 2002 Act. The judge referred to a number of relevant authorities including Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60 and NE-A (Nigeria) [2017] EWCA Civ 239. 12. The judge proceeded to determine whether the effect of the appellant's deportation would have an unduly harsh impact on his wife and child by reference to both paragraph 399 of the immigration rules and s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act. 13. The judge found that the appellant had family and cultural connections to Nigeria as he was in regular contact with his mother, father and adult siblings, and that his family would offer accommodation and assistance to the appellant and his wife and child if they returned to Nigeria. The judge accepted that the appellant lived with his family until he was 13 years old when his parents, ""for reasons best known to them"" arranged for him to go to the UK with a relative stranger. The judge found that the appellant was abused and neglected by his supposed Guardian in the UK and that his parents told the appellant he had to endure it. The judge stated, at [33],""The appellant's evidence is that due to this neglect, abuse and lack of family he became embroiled with gangs and criminality with the end result being his convictions in 2008 and 2011.""14. At [34] the judge accepted that the appellant spent his time in prison busy working and studying to obtain qualifications, that he was currently studying for an accounting qualification, that if he had permission to work in the UK he would do so, that he was ambitious for a better life and wished to be a role model for his son, that he was the primary carer for his son and a committed father, and that he drank limited alcohol infrequently and did not have an alcohol problem. It was for these reasons that the appellant was found to be at low risk of offending. The judge noted however, by reference to PF (Nigeria) [2015] EWCA Civ 251, that rehabilitation in a non-EEA case was of limited significance as it was just one factor relevant to the public interest.15. At [36] the judge referred to her duty under s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and the best interests of NN. The judge noted that NN was 4 years old and had spent his entire life in the care of his mother and father. Although the judge accepted that LN was the breadwinner in the family she did not accept that LN worked for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and gave reasons in support of this conclusion. The judge found that the appellant was genuinely a loving father and that his son would be distraught if separated from him. The judge concluded that it would be in NN's best interests to remain living with his mother and father as a family unit in the UK to enable him to benefit from his rights as a British citizen. The judge then reminded herself that the best interests of children are not a paramount consideration and referred to the relevant authority of ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.16. At [38] the judge considered whether it would be unduly harsh for NN to live in Nigeria. The judge repeated LN's evidence that she did not want her son to live in Nigeria and indicated that she had due regard to the ISW's reports. The judge summarised the ISW's description of the appellant's relationships with his wife and son and noted that the ISW's identified concerns ""? would be applicable to all healthy for-year-olds."" The judge commented that the ISW reports contained very few specific findings about NN and made general observations about how many children seen as different would have difficulties. At [39] the judge explained why it would not be unduly harsh for NN to live in Nigeria. She noted that he would, at least initially, be able to live with his grandparents and extended family, that he had some familiarity with his grandmother and aunt, and that there was an education system and a health system in Nigeria. The judge additionally noted NN's age and the stage of his education, and that his focus was on his immediate family rather than the wider community. The judge accepted that Nigeria was not a developed country, that not all of Nigeria had a reliable electricity supply or running water, and that the lifestyle in Nigeria would be of a lower standard than that available in the UK. The judge accepted that NN would suffer a culture shock if he were to move to Nigeria but he was still relatively young and would have the assistance of his father and extended family. Whilst accepting that any notional move to Nigeria would be ""? undesirable, uncomfortable, difficult, challenging and unwanted"", the judge did not find this would amount to undue harshness.17. At [40] to [43] the judge considered whether it would be unduly harsh for NN to remain in the UK without the appellant. In concluding that it would not be unduly harsh the judge referred to the distress that this would cause NN and LN and, with reference to the ISW's report, that this would have a damaging effect on them. The judge accepted that it was understandable that LN would be suffering from stress and anxiety and that she had some mental ill-health arising from the threat of the appellant's deportation. There was however no evidence to suggest that this was so serious that it required specialist treatment and/or counselling. The judge accepted that the appellant ""? experienced a traumatic time at the hands of his supposed Guardian in the United Kingdom"", and that in this context he committed crimes leading to his two convictions. Taking all relevant considerations in the round the judge concluded that it would not be unduly harsh for NN to remain in the UK without the appellant as he would be in the care of his mother who was a committed and loving parent and would have the assistance from her family. The judge additionally noted that communication with the appellant would not be severed.18. At [44] the judge found that the requirements of paragraph 399(b) of the immigration rules could not be satisfied as the appellant was unlawfully present in the UK when he formed his relationship with LN. The judge then concluded, with reference to s.117C(5), that the appellant's deportation would not have an unduly harsh impact on LN and supported this conclusion with reasons that included the support that LN would receive from the appellant and his family if she went to Nigeria and her own resourcefulness, and the support she would receive in the UK from her own family if she decided to remain in this country. 19. Having found that the appellant could not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 399A of the immigration rules or Exception 1 in s.117C(4) of the 2002 Act, the judge then found, with respect to s.117B, that the appellant was not financially independent as he had never worked in the UK and was supported by LN (at [50](i)). 20. At [51] the judge stated,""I must consider whether there are very compelling circumstances over and above those I must give consideration to under paragraph 399 and 399A. I find that there are not such very compelling circumstances. What has been identified to me it [sic] is the tragic breakup of the family. This is very sad but it is a consequence of deportation.""21. At [52] the judge considered the submissions made in respect of respondent's alleged delay. The judge indicated that she had considered EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 and found that the respondent's actions were not infected with undue delay. She noted that a deportation order was issued in 2014 but was unsigned. This was clearly an administrative error and ""extremely regrettable"" but the judge did not consider that this was evidence that the respondent ""? had little interest in deportation the appellant or that the public interest in the appellant's deportation is diminished."" Having briefly summarised the various stages leading to this appeal the judge did not think that they could be characterised as amounting to undue delay.22. Finally, at [53], the judge said it was made clear by the Supreme Court that the immigration rules do not represent a complete code as regards Article 8, but found, ""when all factors are considered"", that the appellant's deportation was proportionate. The appeal was dismissed.The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision23. The challenge to the judge's decision has evolved since first lodged. Following the decision in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 Mr Southey disavows reliance on the ground that argued that the judge erred in her approach to the harshness of the situation faced by the appellant's son, and in particular, that there had been a failure to take account of relevant matters. In light of the decision in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58 Mr Southey sought to amend his grounds to argue that the judge erred in her approach to the appellant's means. I considered there to be arguable merit in this challenge, it could not have been raised at an earlier time, and there was no objection from Mr Whitwell. I therefore allowed the amendment.24. I summarise the grounds of challenge.25. Mr Southey contends that the judge needed to consider whether the appellant's deportation constituted a violation of Article 8 separately from any consideration under the immigration rules. This is because the immigration rules were not a complete code. In concluding, at [53], that the respondent's decision was proportionate ""? for all the reasons set out in this decision"", the judge failed to give adequate reasons because the earlier reasoning contained in the decision only addressed matters such as the immigration rules. There had been no consideration of the balance that needed to be struck outside of the immigration rules as required by Hesham Ali. 26. An associated ground contends that the judge failed to take account of relevant considerations in her assessment outside of the immigration rules, such as the traumatic circumstances of the appellant having been trafficked into the UK as a child, his active rehabilitation and the low risk he posed to the public, the respondent's delay, the clear best interests of NN and the support network available to the appellant in the UK. The judge's assessment at [53] disclosed little reasoning in respect of these issues outside the immigration rules and only focused on the breakup of the family. It was further submitted that the judge erred in her approach to the issue of 'very compelling circumstances' because there was no reason why the breakup of a family could not reach this test, particularly when account was taken of the circumstances in which the appellant arrived in the UK.27. In reliance on Regina (R) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police and Another [2018] UKSC 47 Mr Southey contends that, because the proportionality of the respondent's decision was in issue, one had to ultimately focus on the cogency of the judge's conclusion and that, considering the appellant's circumstances in the round, it was apparent that there were very compelling circumstances and that relevant factors were not considered as a package, which undermined the cogency of the judge's conclusions. 28. Mr Southey submits that the judge erred in her approach to the best interests of the child. The judge did not adopt a legitimate approach at [37] when she attached limited weight to family life because it was established at a time when the appellant's status was precarious. NN should not be blamed for the appellant's lack of status and precarious status is not relevant to a child (SSHD v SC (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 2112). It was further submitted that no express consideration was given to NN's best interests when deciding whether it would be unduly harsh for him to live either in the UK without the appellant or in Nigeria, and that no account was taken of the submissions that the education and health systems in Nigeria were significantly inferior to that in the UK. In his oral submissions Mr Southey submitted that the SWR's report disclosed the extensive role played by the appellant in caring for his son and that the judge failed to undertake a sufficient assessment of what constituted NN's best interests, including the inferior nature of the health and educational system in Nigeria.29. It is additionally argued that the judge unlawfully failed to assess whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking in circumstances where there was good reason to believe that he was. Mr Southey submitted, in reliance on ES (s82 NIA 2002; negative NRM) Albania [2018] UKUT 00335 (IAC), that the judge was entitled to make findings regarding trafficking and that the circumstances in which the appellant arrived in the UK and offended were obviously relevant to the issues arising under Article 8. There were said to be flaws in the Competent Authority's decision as FG was subsequently convicted of fraud. It appeared that the judge accepted the factual basis upon which the trafficking claim was made, and that there were important rights accruing to victims of trafficking including the right to be provided with assistance, and that the appellant was unlikely to receive appropriate treatment in Nigeria. It was also significant that the appellant required and continues to require significant therapy, implying that he is still undergoing psychological recovery. The support provided by his family constituted an essential part of his rehabilitation. It was further submitted that there was some flexibility in deciding whether limited weight should be given to a family life which had been established when one of the parties' immigration status was precarious if, as a victim of trafficking, the appellant entered the UK as a child and built up a family life with those providing him with support following his trafficking experience. It was further argued that the question whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking was potentially a compelling circumstance, one that had not been considered by the judge. This should have formed part of the judge's assessment of the existence of very compelling circumstances or of her assessment of proportionality outside the immigration rules.30. The judges approach to the delay argument was flawed because she failed to take account of the full period of delay (the deportation order was served on 11 September 2013, and, more importantly, the appellant was released from prison on 22 June 2012). The delay between the appellant's release from prison and the appeal hearing was a particularly significant factor in assessing proportionality because it implied that the respondent did not regard the appellant to be sufficiently high-risk that the public interest required his deportation and detracted from the public interest, and because it allowed the appellant's community ties to strengthen and provided an opportunity to test his rehabilitation. Nor was there any mention by the judge that LN was pregnant with their 2nd child, which occurred during the respondent's delay. 31. The judge erred in her approach to the issue of means as she found that he was no financially independent because he was supported by his wife. In Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58 the Supreme Court held that a person could be financially independent well dependent upon a 3rd party (at [57]). This error was material as it appeared to be accepted that the appellant was supported by his wife.Discussion32. I do not accept Mr Southey's submission that the judge erred in law by failing to consider Article 8 outside the immigration rules. I fully accept that the immigration rules are not a complete code, as established in Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60. This case however was only concerned with the immigration rules and not the amendments that introduced s.117A to D of the 2002 Act. In Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803, Sales LJ stated, at [45], (a point undisturbed on appeal to the Supreme Court)""It is common ground that the starting point for consideration of the proper construction of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of Article 8 which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with, and not in violation of, Article 8. In that regard, both sides affirmed the approach to interpretation of Part 5A to ensure compliance with Article 8 as explained by this court in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662, in particular at [26] and [31].""33. Then at [49] and [50] Sales LJ held, ""? Section 117A(2) does not have the effect that, for example, a court or tribunal has a discretion to say that the maintenance of effective immigration control is not in the public interest, in direct contradiction of the statement of public policy by Parliament in section 117B(1). Where Parliament has itself declared that something is in the public interest - see sections 117B(1), (2), (3) and section 117C(1) - that is definitive as to that aspect of the public interest. But it should be noted that having regard to such considerations does not mandate any particular outcome in an article 8 balancing exercise: a court or tribunal has to take these considerations into account and give them considerable weight, as is appropriate for a definitive statement by Parliament about a particular aspect of the public interest, but they are in principle capable of being outweighed by other relevant considerations which may make it disproportionate under article 8 for an individual to be removed from the UK.Another type of consideration identified in Part 5A to which regard must be had under section 117A(2) is the statement in section 117C(6) that 'the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2' (my emphasis). There is a similar requirement in section 117C(3), on its proper construction: see NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department at [23]-[27]. In these provisions, Parliament has actually specified what the outcome should be of a structured consideration of Article 8 in relation to foreign criminals as set out in section 117C, namely that under the conditions identified there the public interest requires deportation. The 'very compelling circumstances' test in section 117C(3) and (6) provides a safety valve, with an appropriately high threshold of application, for those exceptional cases involving foreign criminals in which the private and family life considerations are so strong that it would be disproportionate and in violation of Article 8 to remove them. If, after working through the decision-making framework in section 117C, a court or tribunal concludes that it is a case in which section 117C(3) or (6) says that the public interest 'requires' deportation, it is not open to the court or tribunal to deny this and to hold that the public interest does not require deportation.""34. In NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 239, considered after Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60, Sir Stephen Richards, stated, at [14] and [15]""In my judgment, the analysis of section 117C(6) in Rhuppiah is correct and should be followed. There is no inconsistency between that analysis and what was said in Hesham Ali. The focus in Hesham Ali, as is conceded, was on the Rules: indeed, Lord Reed noted in terms at paragraph 2 of his judgment that it was unnecessary to consider the amendments to the legislation effected by the Immigration Act 2014, i.e. the provisions of Part 5A of the 2002 Act. Moreover, integral to Lord Reed's reasoning was that the Rules ""are not law ? but a statement of the Secretary of State's administrative practice"" and they ""do not therefore possess the same degree of democratic legitimacy as legislation made by Parliament"" (paragraph 17; see also paragraph 53); and that they do not govern appellate decision-making, although they are relevant to the determination of appeals (paragraph 41). Part 5A of the 2002 Act, by contrast, is primary legislation directed to tribunals and governing their decision-making in relation to Article 8 claims in the context of appeals under the Immigration Acts. I see no reason to doubt what was common ground in Rhuppiah and was drawn from NA (Pakistan), that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of Article 8 which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with Article 8. In particular, if in working through the structured approach one gets to section 117C(6), the proper application of that provision produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in all cases to which it applies. The provision contains more than a statement of policy to which regard must be had as a relevant consideration. Parliament's assessment that ""the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"" is one to which the tribunal is bound by law to give effect.None of this is problematic for the proper application of Article 8. That a requirement of ""very compelling circumstances"" in order to outweigh the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals sentenced to at least four years' imprisonment is compatible with Article 8 was accepted in MF (Nigeria) and in Hesham Ali itself. Of course, the provision to that effect in section 117C(6) must not be applied as if it contained some abstract statutory formula. The context is that of the balancing exercise under Article 8, and the ""very compelling circumstances"" required are circumstances sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in the deportation of the foreign criminals concerned. Provided that a tribunal has that context in mind, however, a finding that ""very compelling circumstances"" do not exist in a case to which section 117C(6) applies will produce a final result, compatible with Article 8, that the public interest requires deportation. There is no room for any additional element in the proportionality balancing exercise under Article 8.""35. For the reasons clearly set out in the above extracts it is clear that the proportionality assessment under Article 8 takes place within the 'very compelling circumstances' provisions of s.117C. There was no requirement for the judge to consider any additional element in the proportionality balancing exercise, as she purported to do at [53]. Given that the factors she considered included an assessment of very compelling circumstances and the statutory factors in Part 5A of the 2002 Act, she did not misdirect herself. 36. I am not persuaded that the judge erred in law by failing to consider whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking. The respondent's bundle contained the decision of the Competent Authority. I have considered the Competent Authority's decision in detail. Although there were 'reasonable grounds' to initially believe the appellant may have been trafficked the Competent Authority concluded, in a Conclusive Grounds decision dated 12 September 2012, that he was not the victim of trafficking. The appellant was not found by the Competent Authority to be a credible witness. The account given by him in the September 2012 decision is significantly at odds with his claim to be in contact with his family in Nigeria. The Competent Authority's decision was adequately reasoned, and disclosed proper direction according to the appropriate legal provisions. It is also apparent that the Competent Authority applied the appropriate 'balance of probabilities' standard of proof. There was no judicial review challenge to the Competent Authority's decision.37. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v MS (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594, a decision decided before the significant amendments to the appeal regime wrought by the Immigration Act 2014, Lord Justice Flaux held, at [69] and [70],""In my judgment, it is absolutely clear that the Court of Appeal in AS (Afghanistan) was limiting the circumstances in which, on a statutory appeal against a removal decision, an appellant can mount an indirect challenge to a negative trafficking decision by the authority (in the circumstances where the appellant has not challenged it by way of judicial review), to where the trafficking decision can be demonstrated to be perverse or irrational or one which was not open to the authority, those expressions being effectively synonymous for present purposes. Mr Lewis is correct that there is a two stage approach. First, a determination whether the trafficking decision is perverse or irrational or one which was not open to the authority and second, only if it is, can the appellant invite the Tribunal to re-determine the relevant facts and take account of subsequent evidence since the decision of the authority was made.Of course, a trafficking decision, whether positive or negative, may well be relevant to the issue before the Tribunal as to the lawfulness of the removal decision. However, an appellant can only invite the tribunal to go behind the trafficking decision and re-determine the factual issues as to whether trafficking has in fact occurred if the decision of the authority is shown to be perverse or irrational or one which was not open to it. This is clearly what Longmore LJ was saying in the last two sentences of [18] of his judgment."" 38. Mr Southey relies on ES and submits that the change in the appeal regime distinguishes MS (Pakistan) as the right of appeal now attaches to a refusal of a human rights claim and not a decision to remove, and because it is no longer possible for a judge to find that a decision is 'not in accordance with the law' as the only grounds available are, inter alia, that the refusal of the human rights claim is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Whilst I accept that the changes are as stated by Mr Southey, I am not persuaded that they render MS (Pakistan) inapplicable to the instant appeal. The principle reason identified by the Upper Tribunal in ES for distinguishing MS (Pakistan) relied on the UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention and the lower standard of proof (the 'real risk' standard) in protection claims (see [27] and [30] to [34] of ES). The standard of proof in human rights claims, such as the underlying claim in the present appeal, is the balance of probabilities, the same standard as that applied by the Competent Authority. Given that the instant appeal does not involve the Refugee Convention and the lower standard of proof, I consider myself bound by the Court of Appeal's decision. 39. Mr Southey additionally relies on FG's conviction for fraud subsequent to the Competent Authority's decision. Although my attention was not drawn to any independent evidence of FG's conviction, I have no reason to doubt the assertion that she was subsequently convicted of fraud. It is however apparent that the Competent Authority were aware of the concerns surrounding the alleged relationship between JT and FG, and therefore FG's character, as the EEA residence permits applications made on 4 August 2004 were refused on 19 January 2005 on the basis that the marriage was bogus. I do not find that the subsequent conviction materially undermines the Competent Authority's conclusion, especially when one considers the significant differences in the account given by the appellant to the Competent Authority in comparison to his present account of events. 40. I note further the absence of clear evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the therapy received by the appellant related to the circumstances of his entry and initial residence in the UK. Mr Southey relied on a letter from the Refugee Therapy Centre, dated 28 February 2018, but this indicated that the organisation did not provide reports for external agencies in any circumstances because of a wish to keep its therapeutic surface for people's mental well-being and not for practical issues such as immigration matters. The letter confirmed the frequency of the appellant's psychotherapy sessions and that he was making gradual progress. I am satisfied the judge did not materially err in law in failing to consider for herself whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking. Had she done so, she would have misdirected herself in law.41. I do not accept Mr Southey's submission that the judge failed to engage in an adequate assessment of NN's best interests. There was no requirement for the judge to refer to or replicate all of the ISW's findings. It is sufficiently clear, having considered the decision holistically, that the judge lawfully engaged with and took account of the ISW's report and that this fed into the judge's assessment of the child's best interests. At [36] the judge noted the principal elements necessary in undertaking a 'best interests' assessment including NN's age, that he resided all his life with his parents, that his mother worked full-time hours, that when NN is not at school he is cared for by the appellant, that the appellant is a loving father, that NN would be distraught by being separated from the appellant, and that as a British citizen it was in NN's best interests to remain with both his parents in the UK. Although the judge did not expressly mention the inferior nature of the Nigerian health and education system or the challenging environment in that country in [36], it is irresistibly clear that the judge appreciated the advantages NN would enjoy in terms of health and education when noting that, if he resided in the UK, he would be able to benefit from all that citizenship entails. The judge did, in any event, make express reference to the existence of an education system and health system in Nigeria, and the unreliability of electricity supply or running water in all parts of Nigeria, at [39], albeit in the context of an undue harshness assessment. This suggests that the judge was, at all times, mindful of these factors.42. Nor am I persuaded that the judge failed to consider NN's best interests when assessing whether the appellant's deportation would have an unduly harsh impact on the child. Having previously identified NN's best interests at [36], it is necessarily implicit in the subsequent assessment of undue harshness, at [37] to [43], that the judge bore in mind the child's best interests. This is particularly apparent at [39] and [43] when the judge considers in detail NN's circumstances if he were to relocate to Nigeria or remain in the UK.43. Mr Southey criticises the judge's accordance of 'due weight' to the fact that the appellant had built his family life with LN and NN in the full knowledge that he had no status to remain in the UK. The paragraph begins, ""in relation to my consideration of the issues below?"" The issues then considered ""below"" related to undue harshness. I am not satisfied that the judge inappropriately attached limited weight to the appellant's relationship with his son in the context of a best interests assessment, which occurred in the preceding paragraph. I bear in mind that, in his skeleton argument (paragraph 5), Mr Southey abandoned the ground that argued that the judge erred in her approach to the harshness of the situation faced by NN. 44. I do have some concern that, by giving ""due weight"" to the appellant's relationship with his son because it was established in the full knowledge that he was present unlawfully, the judge may have attached less weight to the father-son relationship. Neither sections 117B(4) or (5) require the attachment of little weight to a family life relationship between a parent and child. Whilst the judge was undoubtedly entitled (and was indeed obliged) to attach little weight to the private life established by the appellant in the UK, and to the family life relationship with LN, the same does not, at least by reference to s.117B, extend to his relationship with NN, and Zoumbas [2013] 1 WLR 3690 makes it clear that a child must not be blamed for matters for which he is not responsible, such as a parent's conduct. The judge does however consider s.117B at [50], and, in her assessment in this context, does not refer to NN, suggesting that she has not reduced the weight she attached to the father-son relationship because it was established when the appellant was present unlawfully. The judge, in any event, found the relationship between the appellant and NN to be strong [36] and demonstrably attach significant weight to that relationship. 45. Mr Southey helpfully went through the chronology of events supporting his delay argument. I note in particular that the appellant claimed asylum in May 2011, that he was released on licence in June 2012, but the deportation decision was made on 11 September 2013, that the first-tier Tribunal allowed his appeal on the basis that it was not in accordance with the law on 10 October 2014, that the respondent attempted to remove the appellant on 21 December 2015 and that the new decision to deport him was made on 23 January 2016, that he made further representations on 22 February 2016, and that the respondent responded to the submissions by refusing his human rights claim on 22 May 2017.46. Although the appellant was released on licence in June 2012, the initial decision to deport him and the decision to refuse his asylum claim were not served on him until 11 September 2013, a delay of one year and 3 months. Mr Southey accepts that any delay by the First-tier Tribunal in listing the appeal cannot be attributed to the respondent. Following the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on 14 October 2014 there was a further delay of one year and approximately 2 months before the respondent unlawfully attempted to remove the appellant and then issued the new decision to deport him. Following the appellant's further representations in February 2016, there was a further delay of one year and 3 months until the respondent made his decision that was the subject of the appeal before the judge. 47. The judge considered the issue of delay at [52], concluding that there was no 'undue delay'. 'Undue' generally means unwarranted or excessive. It is not apparent from the decision what particular periods of delay were considered by the judge, and it is unfortunate that she did not identify the relevant periods in greater detail given the prominence of these submissions in the arguments presented to her. Although the judge did set out a general chronology of events at [2], she later erroneously stated that the first deportation order was issued in 2014 when it was in fact issued in September 2013. The delays in excess of a year as described above are not uncommon in this jurisdiction, and given that each individual period of delay was, at most, a year and 3 months, I find the judge was entitled to conclude that the delays did not reflect a lack of interest by the respondent in deporting the appellant, or that the public interest was thereby diminished. The delays were nevertheless, when cumulatively considered, relatively significant in the context of a married man with a young child. I therefore accept that the cumulative effect of the delays allowed the appellant's community ties to strengthen and that, even though they were aware of his extremely precarious immigration status, it allowed NL to become pregnant. It is not however apparent that the judge took this consequence of the delays into account. I find this constitutes an error of law, although its materiality remains to be considered.48. I additionally see some merit in Mr Southey's argument that, through no fault of her own, the judge misdirected herself in holding that the appellant was not financially independent because he was supported by LN. I do not read the Supreme Court's decision in Rhuppiah as departing from the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the fact of financial independence is, at most, a neutral factor. The judge however, in finding that the appellant was not financially independent, actively held this against him. It became a further factor in favour of the public interest in the appellant's deportation. Following Rhuppiah, the judge was not entitled to hold this particular public interest against the appellant. I am not however persuaded that this error, on its own, was capable of materially undermining the sustainability of the judge's decision. This is a relatively small factor in the face of what were otherwise strong public interest factors in the appellant's deportation.49. In assessing whether the judge erred in her overall proportionality assessment (with reference to the 'very compelling circumstances' test) I have regard to the conclusions of the Supreme Court in Regina (R) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police and Another, and note that an error of law may be disclosed not by a specific error of principle in a narrow sense, but because of a flaw in the reasoning underlying the First-tier Tribunal's conclusion. 50. whilst I am not persuaded that the judge erred in law in failing to determine whether the appellant was a victim of trafficking, it is nevertheless clear from the decision, read as a whole, that she accepted that the appellant experienced a ""traumatic time at the hands of his supposed guardian"", who abused and neglected him. The judge noted, at [43], that it was in this context that the appellant committed crimes and got involved in a gang. The circumstances in which the appellant came to the UK, as a 13-year-old boy leaving his family and accompanying a relative stranger who mistreated him, whilst not excusing his criminality, may nevertheless constitute a relevant consideration when determining the existence of 'very compelling circumstances'. Whilst the judge was aware of this when assessing the issue of undue harshness, it is not apparent from her brief assessment at [51] that she took this into account.51. I further accept Mr Southey's criticism that the judge's assessment of 'very compelling circumstances' only referred to the breakup of the family. Whilst this was undoubtedly an extremely significant factor, there were other factors relevant to a lawful assessment. I have already mentioned the circumstances in which the appellant entered and resided in the UK and which constituted the context for his drift into criminality. When assessing 'very compelling circumstances', the judge did not take express account of the significant efforts undertaken by the appellant to turn his life around or his length of residence in the UK, or the cumulative delays by the respondent and the impact this had on the establishment of further family and private life ties. Although the judge clearly made positive findings in respect of the appellant's rehabilitation, I am unable to find, even by way of implication, that this was considered in the assessment of very compelling circumstances. Although the judge may well have been entitled, having lawfully considered these other factors, to conclude that they did not amount to very compelling circumstances and therefore would not result in a disproportionate breach of Article 8, I am not satisfied that this would have been an inevitable conclusion. I consequently find that these identified errors, cumulatively considered, render the decision unsafe such that it must be set aside.52. I see no reason in disturbing the factual findings made by the judge. These factual findings are retained. I am aware that an application has been made pursuant to rule 15 (2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to adduce fresh evidence, and I am aware that the appellant's 2nd child has now been born. I grant permission for the new material to be considered. In these circumstances I consider it appropriate to remake the decision at a further hearing. Notice of DecisionThe First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by material errors on points of law and is set aside.The decision will be remade at a further hearing.Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant in this appeal is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. 4 December 2018Signed DateUpper Tribunal Judge Blum",2019-05-13
