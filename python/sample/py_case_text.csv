0,[2019] UKUT 217,"R (on the application of Sutharsan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (UT rule 29(1): time limit) [2019] UKUT 00217 (IAC)In the Upper TribunalImmigration and Asylum ChamberJudicial ReviewNotice of DecisionThe Queen on the application ofNADARAJAH SUTHARSAN ApplicantvSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT RespondentThe 21-day time limit in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 for filing an acknowledgment of service in immigration judicial review proceedings begins to run on the day after the person concerned is provided with a copy of the application for judicial review, not on the day it was sent. A copy that is sent by post will be deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved.Decision of the Honourable Mr Justice LaneFollowing consideration of all documents filed, including the letter dated 21 June 2019 from the applicant's representatives, the Tamil Welfare Association (Newham) UK.The respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed within the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Reasons:1. The applicant contends that the respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed outside the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The respondent asserts that it was served within that period. If the applicant is correct, it is common ground that the respondent has not made an application, accompanied by the requisite fee, for time to be extended.2. So far as relevant, rule 29(1) provides that:-""A person who is sent or provided with a copy of an application for permission"" [to bring judicial review proceedings and who wishes to take part in them] ""must provide to the Upper Tribunal an acknowledgment of service so that it is received no later than no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal sent, or in immigration judicial review proceedings the applicant provided a copy of the application to that person"".3. The applicant says that a copy is provided to the person concerned on the date it is sent to that person. This means the 21-day period begins to run on the day after it was sent, whether or not the person to whom it was sent has received it.3. The applicant's position necessarily involves the proposition that sending and providing amount to the same thing. It is, however, evident from rule 29(1) that the legislature regards sending and providing as different. Otherwise, there would have been no purpose in SI 2011/2343 inserting the words in square brackets, which occurred on 17 October 2011, when UTIAC acquired jurisdiction to decide ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews. 4. Any doubt as to this is dispelled by reading the consultation paper and annexes, which the Tribunal Procedure Committee (TPC) published in 2011, concerning proposed changes to the 2008 Rules, consequent upon the assumption by the Upper Tribunal of jurisdiction in ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews (FCJRs)1. The annex attached to the TPC's consultation paper reveals that the original proposed wording of rule 29 read: ""? so that it is received no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal or in fresh claim judicial review proceedings the applicant sent a copy of the application to that person"". 5. The consultation paper, however, made reference to: ""CPR 58.8(2), which allows a total of 23 days for lodging an acknowledgment of service (2 days for postal service and 21 days from receipt of the application). Rule 29(1) allows 21 days for this to be done. The Committee is considering whether to make special provision for FCJRs that would maintain the 23 day time limit or to specify a shorter time limit given the nature of FCJRs""6. The TPC published a reply to the consultation responses, in which we find the following:""The majority of respondents suggested that the CPR should be replicated in order to avoid having different rules depending on the venue"". The conclusion of the TPC was that it ""agreed that it was appropriate to replicate the CPR time limit"". 7. The amendments to rule 29(1) that were eventually made in 2011 were, therefore, intended to reflect CPR 54.8(2)(a), which governs applications for judicial review in the High Court. CPR 54.8(2)(a) prescribes a period of 21 days ""after service of the claim form"" on the person concerned. The fact that service may not be effected until that person is put in possession of the claim form is made clear by CPR 6.14, which provides that a claim form is deemed to be served on the second business day after completion of what is termed the relevant step under rule 7.5(1). For posting by first class post, the relevant step is ""posting"".8. This legislative background makes it plain that the references to providing in the amended rule 29(1) were used in order to keep fresh claim judicial review (and, now, immigration judicial review) in step with the relevant High Court time limit. The applicant's interpretation, however, would entirely defeat this purpose.9. In Bhavsar (late application for PTA: procedure) [2019] UKUT 00196 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal examined the effect of amendments made by SI 2018/511 to rule 33 (Application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014. The amendments replaced the references in rule 33 to ""provided"" with references to ""sent"". As the Upper Tribunal noted at paragraph 26 of its decision, the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 stated that the replacement of the references was done ""in order to clarify that the time period for an application to be sent to the Tribunal is calculated by reference to the date on which the written reasons for the decision are sent to the party making the application"".10. At paragraph 28 of Bhavsar, the Upper Tribunal said:""Despite the implication in the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 that the substitution of ""sent"" for ""provided"" had been made merely in order ""to clarify"" the position, it is, in our view, clear that a substantive change had in fact been made. As a matter of ordinary language, a person is ""provided"" with a physical thing when he or she receives or takes possession of it. In the present case, that was on 22 June 2018, when the appellant's solicitors received the First-tier Tribunal's decision, along with form IA60. The fourteen-day time limit, accordingly, would have expired on 5 July 2018, but for the amendment to rule 33 made by SI 2018/511.""11. The account in paragraphs 3 to 7 above of how rule 29(1) came to be amended in 2011 underscores the correctness of what was said in Bhavsar. Serving and providing are not synonymous (see also: R (Javed) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 4426 (Admin)).12. It is undoubtedly the fact that something can be provided to a person in a variety of ways, which involve not only sending the thing via an intermediary, such as the Royal Mail, but also providing the thing directly by hand. If the applicant were correct in his assertion that sending a thing amounts to providing it on the date of sending, the applicant could unilaterally shorten the period of 21 days in rule 29(1) by choosing to send the copy application, rather than effecting personal service at the office of the respondent's legal representative, the Government Legal Department. Such an outcome cannot be correct.13. The references to providing in rule 29(1) are, nevertheless, not free from difficulty, in that the 2008 Rules contain no express provision like CPR 6.14, making it clear that a document sent by post by one party to someone other than the Tribunal is deemed to be served/received on the second business day after posting. In this regard, it does not appear that section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 applies (see Syed (curtailment of leave - notice) [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC)). It is plainly in the interests of the overriding objective in rule 2 to interpret the references to providing in rule 29(1) as including the position that a copy application which is sent by post is deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved. Pursuant to rule 2(3)(b), that is how the references will be interpreted by the Tribunal.14. In the application with which I am concerned, the applicant sent a copy of the application to the respondent on 29 May 2019. There is no dispute it was received by the respondent on 30 May 2019 and so deemed service does not arise. In view of what I have said above, it was on 30 May that the respondent was provided with the relevant document for the purposes of rule 29(1). The 21-day period therefore began to run on 31 May and ended on 20 June, which was the day that the acknowledgment of service was received by the Upper Tribunal.

1,[2019] UKUT 216," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Smith (appealable decisions; PTA requirements; anonymity) [2019] UKUT 00216 (IAC) THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 7 May 2019    …………………………………   Before THE HON. MR JUSTICE LANE, PRESIDENT UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GILL UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE FINCH Between THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Appellant and MORGAN HAYAT SMITH (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE) Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer For the Respondent: Mr B. Amunwa, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co Solicitors (1) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (2) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (3) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (4) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (2) above). (5) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (6) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (7) When deciding whether to make an anonymity direction, the starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Subject to statutory prohibitions on disclosure, any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. DECISION AND REASONS A. Introduction The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of Belgium, born in July 1988. He has a history of offending as a juvenile. As an adult, he was convicted in 2017 of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress; four counts of battery; assaulting a constable; and failing to surrender to custody at the appointed time. The offence of battery was committed whilst the claimant was on bail. On 15 September 2017, after considering the claimant’s representations as to why he should not be deported from the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State made a deportation order against the claimant. He did not appeal against that decision and was deported on 3 November 2017. Two days later, the claimant attempted to return but was refused entry to the United Kingdom. On 14 January 2018, the claimant was arrested by police, having entered in breach of the deportation order. The claimant was removed on 18 March 2018. The following day, he was encountered embarking on a ferry in Scotland. He was removed again on 7 May 2018. On 31 May 2018, the claimant again entered the United Kingdom, in breach of the deportation order. On 15 June 2018, the claimant was convicted of knowingly entering the United Kingdom in breach of the deportation order, for which he was fined. B. The decision letter Those acting for the claimant subsequently made representations, which the Secretary of State treated as an application for the deportation order to be revoked. On 19 July 2018, the Secretary of State explained why he had, in effect, decided not to do so. The letter took account of the claimant’s assertion that he had lived in the United Kingdom for the majority of his life, having lived here between the ages of 5 and 9 before returning to the United Kingdom in 2011 aged 12. The Secretary of State, on the basis of the evidence submitted, refused to accept that the claimant had been resident in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”), for a continuous period of five years. The decision letter noted that the claimant had “lost his temper on three separate occasions against 2 females and on those occasions, he in fits of anger assaulted both of them”. This included pushing his ex-partner by the throat until she passed out, after which he “continued to torment her by posting private and indecent photographs of her on the internet in order to humiliate her”. On another occasion, the claimant threw items around his flat, hitting his current partner with a wooden incense dispenser, as a result of which she was taken to hospital for treatment. He subsequently assaulted his current partner by slamming her into a bathroom mirror, before pinning her down on the floor and placing a blanket around her face and neck. The decision letter found that the claimant had a propensity to reoffend and represented a very genuine and persistent sufficiently serious threat to the public to justify maintaining his deportation. Having considered the issue of proportionality, by reference to the claimant’s submissions about difficulties he would face in Belgium, the letter concluded that it would be reasonable to expect the claimant to go to Belgium and resume his life there. The letter explained in detail why, in circumstances of the claimant’s case, his deportation to Belgium would not disproportionately interfere with his rehabilitation. At paragraph 58 of the letter, the Secretary of State concluded that deportation was proportionate and in accordance with the principles and regulations of 23(6)(b) of the 2016 Regulations. The decision letter then turned to consider Article 8 of the ECHR. Paragraph 59 reads:- “In addition to considering your client’s position under EU law and the EA Regulations 2016, consideration has separately been given to whether your client’s deportation would breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).” The letter noted the various elements of the claimant’s Article 8 claim, which were that he had a girlfriend in the United Kingdom, who was pregnant; that his mother remained in the United Kingdom; and that he had established a private life by virtue of his residence and education in the United Kingdom. So far as the claimant’s partner was concerned, the Secretary of State considered that the claimant did not have a genuine and subsisting relationship with her, in light of his conviction for battery against that partner. There was also no evidence of co-habitation. So far as private life was concerned, the letter explained why the Secretary of State did not consider that the claimant was socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. This was because the claimant was a persistent offender, having been convicted 8 times of 15 offences within a relatively short period of time in the United Kingdom and his “conviction history indicates an anti-social attitude towards the public and community and shows that he has not integrated into the United Kingdom society”. It was not considered that there would be very significant obstacles to the claimant’s integration into Belgium. At paragraph 79 of the letter, the Secretary of State undertook an analysis of whether there were very compelling circumstances, such as to make it incompatible with Article 8 for the claimant to be deported. For the reasons given, it was concluded that there were no such circumstances in the claimant’s case. Paragraph 84 of the letter concluded the Article 8 analysis as follows:- “Having carefully considered the facts about [the claimant’s] circumstances it is considered that [the claimant’s] deportation would not breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under ECHR Article 8 because the public interest in deporting [the claimant] outweighs his right to private and family life” Under the heading “Appeal”, the letter told the claimant that “you have a right of appeal against the decision under regulation 36 and 37 of the 2016 EEA Regulations. Information on how to appeal and the time limits for appealing are contained in the attached notice”. C. Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal On 3 August 2018, the claimant (who remained in the United Kingdom) filed a notice of appeal in the First-tier Tribunal. The grounds of appeal contended that the claimant did not meet the threshold for deportation of an EEA national with permanent residence and that his deportation would disproportionately interfere with his EU rights “and his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights, including article 8”. The case was heard at Harmondsworth on 15 October 2018 by Immigration Judge Lal. The claimant was present at the hearing and gave evidence, upon which he was cross-examined. The judge also heard evidence from the claimant’s mother and his current partner “who confirmed that she had been the victim of the [claimant’s] offending in the past but she thought that he had changed” (paragraph 60 of the decision). The judge found that the claimant had been in the United Kingdom for over five years and had acquired a permanent right of residence. The judge was satisfied that the claimant “did produce credible evidence of some insight into his crimes” and that he had “reasonably addressed issues of anger management, the impact of his actions on victims and how he would deal with those situations which he accepts were the cause of his previous problems”. The judge concluded that deportation on serious grounds of public policy/public security “are not made out”, finding that the claimant is “back with his partner and he has no links with Belgium” (paragraph 25). There was “credible evidence” that the claimant “has family life in the UK with his mother and that all his siblings and his partner are here and it would be disproportionate to expect [the claimant] to leave the UK at the present time” (paragraph 26). In the light of these findings, the judge allowed “the appeal against the deportation order” (paragraph 28). Paragraph 27 of the judge’s decision reads as follows:- “27. In the light of its findings above the Tribunal did not go on to consider Article 8 separately.” D. Challenging the First-tier Tribunal’s decision The Secretary of State applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the judge’s decision to allow the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. The grounds contended that the judge had been wrong to conclude that the claimant had acquired a permanent right of residence, given that “residence alone is insufficient” and there were no findings that the claimant had lived for the requisite time in accordance with the 2016 Regulations. That error infected the judge’s proportionality findings. The judge had also failed to have regard to Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations, wherein paragraph 3 was of particular relevance, given the claimant’s persistent offending. The judge had also, according to the Secretary of State, failed to give adequate reasons for the findings in respect of the claimant’s criminal offending; in particular, since the pre-sentence report considered the claimant to be at high risk of causing serious harm to women. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 1 November 2018, by reference to each of the Secretary of State’s grounds. On 24 January 2019, shortly before the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, the claimant’s solicitors filed a response under rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (“the 2008 Rules”). The response contended that the First-tier Tribunal judge had not erred in his conclusions in respect of the 2016 Regulations. The response also, however, contained what was described as a “cross appeal”, in which the claimant “hereby makes an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (directly) to cross appeal the determination of FTJ Lal in respect of the findings (specifically non-findings) in relation to Article 8 ECHR” (paragraph 16). The response went on to give reasons why the application for permission was being made out of time. As to this, the claimant:- “ … asks the Court (sic) to note that the [claimant] appealed on two grounds against the decision of the SSHD; firstly that the decision was in breach of EU Law and secondly that the decision breached his rights under ECHR. The appeal was allowed on the former ground and that therefore there was no benefit in him appealing the decision in relation to the latter. If it were the case that Appellant’s (sic) should appeal on all grounds (even less favourable) to which they have been successful on it will result in a chaotic administration of the Tribunal appeal system and contrary to the overriding objective in both the FTT and Upper Tier Procedure Rules” (paragraph 18). The response stated that the Secretary of State had made a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim and that an appeal against that refusal was, accordingly, before the First-tier Tribunal judge. It “was not open to him to just decide not to deal with it as he did in paragraph 27 of the determination and reasons”. The response explained that the claimant’s human rights claim was, in part, based on the fact that he contended he had an entitlement to British citizenship through his adopted British father. There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to support this contention, including an adoption certificate. The First-tier Tribunal judge, when faced with this submission, declined to deal with it. The relevant part of the judge’s decision is as follows: - “9. Mr Grennan [Home Office Presenting Officer] submitted that the proper remedy for the [claimant] was by way of judicial review and this of nationality (sic) had never been raised before. He urged the Tribunal to carry on with the appeal. 10. The Tribunal agreed with Mr Grennan as it was faced with an appeal against the deportation order. If it was to be now advanced that the [claimant] was not a national of the receiving country than that [sic] had to be specifically raised with the SSHD. It had not been done so in this case [sic].” F. Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal The appeal came before Julian Knowles J, and Upper Tribunal Judge Gill for hearing on 29 January 2019. The hearing was adjourned. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill gave directions on 30 January, requiring the Secretary of State to explain his reasons for failing to comply with earlier directions of the Upper Tribunal, which had required service of a skeleton argument. She also directed that the parties should file and serve skeleton arguments addressing, inter alia, whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, given that regulation 34(4) of the 2016 Regulations required an application to revoke an EA deportation order to be made from outside the United Kingdom; and whether the permission of the First-tier Tribunal/Upper Tribunal was required in order for the claimant to cross-appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge on the ground that the judge did not consider the claimant’s Article 8 claim. The adjourned hearing was heard by the present constitution of the Upper Tribunal on 7 May 2019. By that time, the parties had each served a number of skeleton arguments, speaking notes and applications. We found these documents of considerable assistance, supplemented as they were by the oral submissions of Mr Jarvis and Mr Amunwa. G. The jurisdictional issue The first issue is whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions of 30 January referred to regulation 34. So far as relevant, this reads as follows: - “Revocation of deportation and exclusion orders 34.- (1) An exclusion order remains in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A deportation order remains in force— until the order is revoked under this regulation; or for the period specified in the order. (3) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may only apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked on the basis that there has been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (4) An application under paragraph (3) must set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (5) On receipt of an application under paragraph (3), the Secretary of State must revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (6) The Secretary of State must take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” So far as appeals are concerned, regulation 37, again so far as relevant, provides as follows: - “37.- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person may not appeal under regulation 36 whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - (a) to refuse to admit that person to the United Kingdom; (b) to revoke that person’s admission to the United Kingdom; (c) to make an exclusion order against that person; (d) to refuse to revoke a deportation or exclusion order made against the person; … 37.- (2) Sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of paragraph (1) do not apply where the person is in the United Kingdom; and - …” The first point to observe is that neither the representatives nor the First-tier Tribunal judge appeared to have been aware at all of what is said in regulations 34 and 37. So far as the First-tier Tribunal judge was concerned, this may be because the judge considered, wrongly, that the EEA appeal was against the Secretary of State’s decision to make a deportation order against the claimant, rather than its being against the decision to refuse to revoke that order. This is apparent from paragraphs 3 and 29 of the Judge’s decision. It is also apparent that the writer of the Secretary of State’s decision letter was unaware of regulation 34(4), which – as we see - provides that an application to revoke a deportation order may be made only whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. Whether the Secretary of State is able to waive that requirement in such a way as to keep the resulting decision within the ambit of the 2016 Regulations is a moot point. It is, however, an issue upon which the parties did not make discrete submissions and, in the circumstances, we are not persuaded that it is appropriate for us to say more about it. Attention in fact focused upon regulation 37(1)(d) which, as we can also see, provides in terms that a person may not appeal whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against that person. The appellant was in the United Kingdom when the notice of appeal was filed. In Anwar and Adjo v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1275, the Court of Appeal considered the effect of section 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which, as then in force, provided as follows: “92. Appeal from within United Kingdom: general (1) A person may not appeal under section 82(1) while he is in the United Kingdom unless his appeal is of a kind to which this section applies. (2) This section applies to an appeal against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(c), (d), (e), (f) and (j). ….. (4) This section also applies to an appeal against an immigration decision if the appellant— (a) has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim, while in the United Kingdom, or ……” In Nirula v the First-tier Tribunal (Asylum and Immigration Chamber & another) and Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1436, the Court of Appeal explained that Sedley LJ’s judgment in Anwar had, in effect, been misunderstood: - “27. The question that arose in Anwar was whether a tribunal could proceed to a determination in a deception case if the appellant was inside the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State had determined that the appellant had obtained leave to remain by deception; on appeal the Secretary of State objected to the tribunal hearing the appeal because the appellant was in the United Kingdom. The tribunal decided it did have jurisdiction and, moreover, that the appellant had not obtained leave by deception. The Secretary of State obtained an order for reconsideration and, on reconsideration, the AIT decided that the appeal could not be pursued while the appellant remained in the United Kingdom and there was thus no jurisdiction in the tribunal to entertain the appeal. This court then granted permission to appeal to Mr Anwar as well as to another appellant (Ms Pangeyo) who raised the same point. By the time Mr Anwar's appeal came to be heard, the Secretary of State had agreed that he had not obtained leave by deception but since the case was ready for argument, both sides were heard on the question of jurisdiction ""at the court's request"" (para 9). ” 28. Anwar is therefore a considered decision of this court, contained in a reserved judgment, on the question whether a tribunal (then the AIT, now the FTT) has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against removal in a deception case when the appellant is in the United Kingdom. Sedley LJ (with whom Lloyd and Sullivan LJJ agreed) set out the facts, the statutory provisions and the issues, explaining how the first tribunal came to consider that they did have jurisdiction. He then proceeded to decide the jurisdiction point under the heading ""Jurisdiction"" 29. “…In circumstances in which this court has requested argument on a point about jurisdiction and has expressly decided that question, its reasoning must be treated as part of the ratio of the case. Mr Ockelton thought that because the point on jurisdiction had been taken in Anwar's two cases as per paragraph 23 above, the whole of the rest of this passage was obiter with the result that, had it been relevant to his decision, he could have disagreed with it because it was wrong. This is with respect a misunderstanding of the doctrine of precedent in two quite separate ways. In the first place, judges at first instance should accept a considered judgment of this court on a question of jurisdiction as a judgment that binds them. In the second place Mr Ockelton was able to decide (in my view correctly) that the point on jurisdiction had been taken in this case. In these circumstances his own remarks about what the position would be if the point had not been taken at all (or not been taken by the right person) were themselves obiter, as he himself acknowledges in his judgment. On the basis on which Mr Ockelton proceeded (namely that the views on jurisdiction in Anwar were obiter), it is not appropriate for a first instance judge to say obiter that considered remarks of this court are wrong. One consequence is a disruption to the body of authority by which tribunals are guided. If he believes that the view of this court is wrong, a judge of first instance should give permission to appeal. If this court where it falls for decision in an appropriate case considers the view to be wrong (and obiter) it will say so and first instance tribunals will know where they are. 30. Of course any decision of this court is only authority for what it decides and for any reasoning necessary for that decision. One thing that is immediately clear from paragraphs 19-23 of the Anwar decision is that nothing is said on the question whether the tribunal is entitled to take a point on its own jurisdiction of its own motion. That is a point which remains open for decision. It is not a particularly difficult decision. In my view any tribunal is entitled (and indeed well advised) to air any doubts it has about its jurisdiction and invite submissions on that question and then decide it. Anwar does not question that proposition in any way. 31. Mr Ockelton, however, thought (para 47(b)) that it was ""implicit"" in Anwar that the jurisdiction point has to be taken by the party affected and it is true that in paragraph 19 of his judgment Sedley LJ says that the point would operate in bar of the proceedings ""once the point was taken by the Home Office"". But that did not mean that only the Home Office could take the point: it simply reflected the fact that in the two cases before the court the Home Office had in fact taken the point. In any event there is an air of unreality in the suggestion that, if the tribunal takes the point, the Home Office does not. In the first place, the Home Office may not be represented before the tribunal; in that event it would border on the absurd to say that the tribunal cannot take the point of its own motion. If the Home Office is represented (as it was in this case), the representative will naturally permit the tribunal to make the running. If the appellant fails to persuade the tribunal that it has jurisdiction, it would again border on the absurd for the tribunal to have specifically to ask the Home Office representative if he wants to object to its jurisdiction to hear the appeal and to wait for an affirmative answer. If the Home Office does not think it fair or right to take the point it can always say so (and in a case such as Anwar it may have a public law duty to say so) and the tribunal can then proceed. 32. Mr Ockelton also thought (para 47(c)) it wrong to say that a failure to consider the issue of jurisdiction can give a tribunal a jurisdiction it would not otherwise have. Anwar does not so say. What it does say is that the Secretary of State can choose not to take any jurisdictional objection if she wishes to take that course, just as a defendant can waive his entitlement to plead limitation or, more likely, choose not to plead a limitation defence. If a tribunal gives a decision without anybody considering the jurisdictional position, the decision may be precarious but as Mr Ockelton himself points out in para 53 the decision stands until set aside. It will become less precarious once the time for applying for permission to appeal has expired. 33. Mr Ockelton also pointed out (para 47(a)) that there was no consideration in Anwar of the terms of the Secretary of State's Notice of Decision. In the present case the Notice of Decision does expressly say that Mr Nirula had a right of appeal which he could exercise ""After removal"". Mr Ockelton considered that, if it was necessary for the Secretary of State to take the jurisdiction point, she had taken it then. For my part, I agree with that conclusion but that does not in any way influence my decision that the jurisdiction point can be taken by the tribunal just as much as by the Secretary of State. 34. I would therefore reject Mr Malik's submission that the Secretary of State had herself to take the jurisdictional point and would hold that it was open to the FTT itself to do so. It made the correct decision on the point since it was clear that Mr Nirula was not abroad – he was actually in the room at the appeal hearing.” In the light of Nirula, it is, therefore, plain that, regardless of what occurred (or, more to the point, did not occur) at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal is entitled to take the “jurisdiction” point and that, if we conclude the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal under the 2016 Regulations, this was an error of law. Neither Mr Jarvis nor Mr Amunwa sought to argue the contrary. Instead, the claimant’s case for saying that the First-tier Tribunal did have jurisdiction rests upon the judgment of Michael Fordham QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, in BXS v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 737 (Admin). BXS concerned the effect of regulation 24A of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, which provided as follows:- “24A (1) A deportation or exclusion order shall remain in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked if the person considers that there been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (3) An application under paragraph (2) shall set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (4) On receipt of an application under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (5) The Secretary of State shall take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” Regulation 27(1) of the 2006 Regulations provided that: - “(1) … a person may not appeal under regulation 26 whilst he is in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - … to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against him.” The following provisions of the judgment of the deputy judge are relevant for our purposes: - “23. If, … the uncompromising language of Regulation 24A, which describes an exclusive route of revocation under its provisions and requires that an application must be out of country, were incompatible either with EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights, then I would have no hesitation in concluding that that uncompromising effect could not lawfully be visited on a claimant for whom it would be such a violation. Whether by reading in words or reading the provision down, there would in my judgment be no difficulty in arriving at that conclusion. There are no clear words of primary legislation (for the purposes of section 3 of the Human Rights Act) that would mandate the maintenance of the otherwise uncompromising shape of Regulation 24A.” 24. What arises in the present case is a question as to whether the mere act of removing an individual pursuant to an EEA deportation order, so that they are placed in the position envisaged by Regulation 24A, is of itself a violation of their human rights. It is not difficult to think of examples where that action would plainly be a violation of human rights. The fact that the regulations permit the individual from abroad to apply for the deportation order to be revoked may very well be a good and perhaps a complete answer in most case when considering the implications of the ongoing exclusionary effect of a deportation order. But one can suppose examples of an individual who is not fit to fly, or examples of an individual whose family life will necessarily be harmed by the action of removing them, or by the necessary period of exclusion from the United Kingdom while they make the envisaged out of country application or pursue an out of country appeal. Circumstances of that nature can be envisaged in which that action of itself could constitute a violation of Convention rights. That being so, if Regulation 24A stood alone and were exhaustive of all remedies and rights of the individual, then there would, in my judgment, be an incompatibility with the human rights protections guaranteed by the Human Rights Act. In such a case, as it seems to me, the Secretary of State would only be acting consistently with her statutory human rights duty (under section 6 of the Human Rights Act) where the removal, of itself, could be said to be consistent with and not to violate those applicable human rights. That does lead to two conclusions. … 54. As for in-country appeal or out of country appeal, in my judgment, it must follow that if revocation can lawfully and justifiably be required to be pursued out of country, then it follows that insistence that any consequential appeal be out of country can also be justified. I ought to add that, in fact, as it happens, the out of country appeal position was already part of the EEA regime, not only from 2006 but, in fact, going to the previous Regulations of 2000. I ought also to add, in the context of appeal rights, that parliament has in section 109 of the 2002 Act recognised that different appeal provisions have been made in EEA cases than in non-EEA. None of that, of course, was to empower the making of provisions that were contrary to Convention rights. … 56. My answer to issue 1 then, for all those reasons, is that there is no incompatibility, either in EU or Human Rights Act terms, in the insistence, leaving aside the narrow human rights point which I have analysed, the insistence on an application for revocation based on change of circumstances and human rights and an appeal being pursued out of country, even though they would not be in a non EEA case. … 59. I ought to make it clear, at this point, that I do not accept the submission that the decision of 19 March 2013 was of itself an unlawful one in the light of the now recognised relevance that article 8 can have for a removal. The same is true of the letter of 28 March 2013 from UKBA. It is right that the Secretary of State was not at that stage considering the article 8 implications of the mere act of removal. Moreover, I have held that that is a proper human rights argument which an individual must always be entitled to raise and which engages the Secretary of State's section 6 Human Rights Act duty. However, the fact in this case is that the claimant's solicitors very clearly were invoking as the relevant provision, regulation 24A, and were inviting a revocation based on material change in the circumstances. In circumstances where that contention was rejected and in which I have held that the regulation which requires the application to be out of country is compatible both with EU and ECHR law, and in circumstances where the Secretary of State came later in the decision 15 November 2013 to grapple with article 18 and the question of removal, there is no ground on which the court could be justified in intervening. Nor, in my judgment, could there be any utility in the point so as to justify relief.” The Upper Tribunal accepts the submissions of Mr Jarvis, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that it is not possible to extract from the judgment in BXS any support for the proposition that, as a general matter, regulation 37(1)(d) of the 2016 Regulations should be somehow “read down”, so as to enable the present claimant to prosecute an appeal under those Regulations whilst he is in the United Kingdom. What concerned the deputy judge was the fact that there might be circumstances in which the mere fact of removal could violate Article 8 of the ECHR. As Mr Jarvis pointed out, however, regulation 33 of the 2016 Regulations requires the Secretary of State, when giving directions for removal, to turn his mind specifically to that issue, in circumstances where the individual concerned has not appealed against the EEA decision, but would be entitled to do so and remains within time to do so, from within the United Kingdom; or where the individual has so appealed but the appeal has not been finally determined. In the claimant’s case, the decision to remove by way of deportation was taken in 2017, when he was in the United Kingdom. The claimant did not challenge that decision. Furthermore and in any event, we have seen that the decision letter in the claimant’s case separately addressed the claimant’s submissions by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. The letter thus comprised two separate decisions; namely, a decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order and a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim. Section 82(1)(b) gives a person a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal where the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights claim made by that person. Section 84(2) provides that the ground of appeal is that removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Accordingly, the claimant was entitled, through the mechanism of the human rights appeal, to contend that his removal would violate Article 8, including (if it were the position) that the mere fact of his removal would constitute such a violation, irrespective of the outcome of his out of country appeal under the 2016 Regulations. In the light of paragraphs 29 to 39 above, we conclude that the First-tier Tribunal judge did not have jurisdiction to determine the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations and that he erred in law in purporting to do so. The notice of appeal filed in August 2018 was of no effect. We set aside the judge’s decision in respect of the 2016 Regulations and remake it by substituting a decision formally dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction. H. The human rights appeal For the reasons we have just given, the First-tier Tribunal judge was, in fact, seized of an appeal under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. That is accepted by Mr Jarvis and also by his colleague, Mr Wilding, in the latter’s skeleton argument of 12 February 2019. The position is, accordingly, exactly that hypothesised by Sales LJ at paragraph 30 of Amirteymour v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 353, albeit by reference to the previous legislative regime: “Depending on the facts, if the Secretary of State did happen to address Article 8 arguments in her decision letter in such a case, it might be possible to say that the Secretary of State had waived the requirement for an application form to be completed in respect of her exercise of her residual discretion under the 1971 Act by reference to Article 8 and that she had then made two decisions, an “EEA decision” in relation to entitlements under the EEA Regulations and an “immigration decision” within the scope of section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, with distinct rights of appeal under regulation 26(1) and under section 82(1) respectively……..” It would be desirable if, henceforth, the Secretary of State were to make it plain in decision letters of the present kind that he is not only deciding an application by reference to 2016 Regulations but also refusing a human rights claim under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. Such an approach may well have assisted the parties and the judge in the present case. As we have noted, the claimant’s grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal included a specific reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. That could only be taken as a challenge to the passages of the Secretary of State’s decision letter, where article 8 was expressly and extensively considered. Section 86(2)(a) imposes a duty on the First-tier Tribunal to determine any matter raised as a ground of appeal. At paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, however, the judge “did not go on to consider Article 8” in the light of his findings in respect of the 2016 Regulations. (a) Did the judge make a decision? Before us, there was some discussion as to whether paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision constituted a decision for the purposes of section 11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. This provision confers a right of appeal “on any point of law arising from a decision made by the First-tier Tribunal other than an excluded decision”. Mr Jarvis indicated that the Secretary of State might wish to reserve his position on this matter. With respect to Mr Jarvis, the answer is, in our view, manifest. In paragraph 27, the First-tier Tribunal judge was making a decision not to consider Article 8. That was a decision in violation of the obligation placed upon the Tribunal by section 84 of the 2002 Act. It would, we find, be highly undesirable if the position were otherwise. If a judge’s refusal to decide a human rights appeal cannot be categorised as a decision within the scope of section 11(1) of the 2007 Act, the only remedy will be judicial review. As the present case shows, such as a bifurcation of routes of challenge would give rise to complexity, delay and expense. It cannot have been Parliament’s intention, in enacting the 2007 Act, to bring about such a state of affairs. (b) Challenging the judge’s decision Having said this, how should the claimant have sought to challenge the decision in paragraph 27? Here, attention focuses on rule 24 (response to the notice of appeal) of the 2008 Rules. So far as relevant, this provides as follows: - “24. … (1)(A) Subject to any direction given by the Upper Tribunal, a respondent may provide a response to a notice of appeal. (2) Any response provided under paragraph (1A) must be in writing and must be sent or delivered to the Upper Tribunal so that it is received. (a) if an application for permission to appeal stands as the notice of appeal, (which it does here) no later than 1 month after the date on which the Respondent was sent notice that permission to appeal had been granted; … (3) The response must state - … (e) the grounds on which the respondent relies, including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another tribunal), any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely in the appeal; and … "" In EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal had before it a case in which the claimants had succeeded in the First-tier Tribunal on Article 3 grounds, by reason of them facing a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to Ethiopia, but where the First-tier Tribunal had dismissed their appeals on asylum grounds, on the basis that the claimants were excluded from the benefits of the Refugee Convention (and, likewise, from those of the Qualification Directive). The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission to appeal against the decision to allow the appeal on Article 3 grounds, following which the claimants filed responses under rule 24, in which they contended that their appeals should have been allowed under the Refugee Convention etc. The Upper Tribunal found as follows: - “33. Mr Eicke said that we have no power except that given us by statute and so we have no power to hear an appeal without permission. Parliament says unequivocally that a right may be exercised only with permission (2007 Act section 13(3)). An application can only be made in writing (First-tier Tribunal Rules, rule 24(1)) and an application for permission cannot be entertained by the Upper Tribunal unless an application has been made first to the First-tier Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Rules 21(2)(b)). Mr Eicke said that it made no sense for provisions that required permission to be obtained before a hearing in writing from a First-tier Judge to be swept aside and replaced by a system that enabled a respondent to an appeal to assert as of right arguments that were raised by the respondent in a notice of appeal which could otherwise only be raised with permission given in response to a written application. 34 Miss Dubinsky contended that appeal rights cannot be lightly displaced but we agree with Mr Eicke that we cannot give ourselves jurisdiction we do not have and it is not for us to create a right of appeal without permission. The claimants cannot appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal because they do not have permission to appeal and the Upper Tribunal has no power to give permission to appeal unless the First-tier Tribunal has refused permission (rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). 35. It does not follow from this that there are no circumstances when claimants would be unable to argue that any of the findings adverse to the respondent are wrong or that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by not allowing the appeal for more reasons than it did but the claimants cannot rely on rule 24 notices as an alternative to seeking permission to appeal. 36. Mr Eicke submitted that a rule 24 Notice was analogous to a Respondent’s Notice under rule 52 of the Civil Procedure Rules. There a party that is seeking permission to appeal from the appeal court must ask for permission and a party that (alternatively) wishes to ask the appeal court to uphold the order of the lower court for reasons different from or additional to those given by the lower court must give notice of that intention. His point was that the need for permission to cross-appeal was well understood in civil proceedings and seeking it was not something that the respondent to an appeal in the Upper Tribunal could be expected to ignore. 37. In many ways the provisions of rule 52 of the CPR are analogous to a rule 24 Notice but they are not the same. Under rule 52.3(2) of the CPR a party that does not have permission to appeal from the lower courts can seek it from the higher court but in the civil courts the failure to secure permission from the lower court (even if through culpable neglect) can be remedied by the higher court but the failure to seek permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal cannot be corrected by the Upper Tribunal. The First-tier Tribunal must decide a written application for permission to appeal before the Upper Tribunal can be involved (see rule 24(1) of the 2005 Rules and rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). This is a cumbersome procedure once proceedings have begun before the Upper Tribunal. An application in writing can be made at any stage, and a judge deciding a case in the Upper Tribunal could no doubt withdraw and determine a written application for permission to appeal as a judge of the First-tier Tribunal. However if the judge did not extend time (for such an application would almost always be very late) or refused permission to appeal there would no doubt be an application for an adjournment so that the papers could be put before a judge sitting the Upper Tribunal. This, we find, must be the deliberate intention of the rules and rather underlines the importance of a party that needs permission to appeal seeking it in accordance with the prescribe time scales and well before a rule 24 notice would ordinarily be appropriate. 38. Against this background we look carefully at the terms of rule 24 of the Upper Tribunal Rules. Although the rule prescribes a time scale for providing a respondent’s notice and prescribes its contents, the rule does not create a general obligation on a respondent to provide a notice at all. Rather if the respondent chooses to send a notice then rule 24 prescribes its content. In this case directions echo the rule and specify the contents of a Notice rather than insist on one being served. 39. Certain of the requirements are informative rather than controversial, such as stating the respondent’s name and address, whether the respondent wants a hearing and, usefully, whether or not the respondent opposes the appeal. Rule 24(3)(e), it was submitted, assists the appellant. It requires the respondent to state in the response: “The grounds on which the respondent relies including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another Tribunal) any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely on in the appeal.” 40. The 2002 Act provides statutory grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (see section 84(1)) but the Secretary of State can never appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and so cannot rely strictly on the grounds listed at section 84(1) which are all grounds of appeal against an immigration decision. It follows that “grounds” in rule 24 must have a wider meaning and include any reason relied upon by the parties to support the decision. It does not follow that a respondent can raise a point in a response that should have been raised in the respondent’s own appeal. 41. Ms Dubinsky argued that the rule 24 response permitted her to argue, without seeking permission to appeal, that the First-tier Tribunal should have resolved any point in the claimant’s favour that the claimant relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that this rule is incapable of being interpreted in a way that does not assume that a respondent can challenge a First-tier Tribunal’s decision in this manner without permission to appeal having been granted. Ms Dubinsky argued that a respondent who opposes an appeal can be expected, without need for express confirmation, to rely on grounds which were successful before the First-tier Tribunal. It would hardly be informative for an appellant before the First-tier Tribunal who succeeded in persuading the First-tier Tribunal (for example) that a decision was not in accordance with the immigration rules (section 84(1)(a)) to be required to state in a notice that it relied on the same successful ground when responding to an appeal brought by the Secretary of State and the rule makes no such requirement. Rule 24(3)(e) requires the respondent to state if it intends to rely on grounds that were unsuccessful “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” but intends to rely on in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that the rule does not make sense unless it is interpreted to mean, without qualification, that there is a right to say that a ground that was unsuccessful before the First-tier Tribunal should have succeeded. 42. When Mr Eicke addressed us on rule 24(3)(e) he tried to circumvent Ms Dubinsky’s submission by emphasising that the claimants were required to identify any grounds on which they intended to rely including grounds “on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal”. He said that the words “which are the subject of the appeal” are crucial. The proceedings which are the subject of the appeal were not, he submitted, all the proceedings that were before the First-tier Tribunal, but only the proceedings that were before us and the proceedings before us, were identified by reference to the grant of permission to appeal. Clearly, if he is right, the points relied on by the claimants are excluded because they were not part of that grant. 43. The bright line distinction between the First-tier section 85 appeal and the Upper Tier section 11 appeal suggested by Mr Eicke’s argument is inconsistent with the continuum suggested by section 104(4) of the 2002 Act and by rule 17A of the Upper Tribunal Rules. A section 11 appeal does not continue when a section 85 appeal has been abandoned. Similarly a section 11 appeal does not exist without regard to the section 85 appeal that encapsulated the dispute between the parties. In some ways this is an unattractive line of argument. It follows that we do not accept that the words “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” are limited to the grounds on which permission to appeal has been given. The “proceedings” that are the “subject of the appeal” are those that came before the First-tier Tribunal and it is those “proceedings” that are the subject to further appeal. 44. Ms Dubinsky’s contention that rule 24 is meaningless unless it permits raising any points that failed to impress the First-tier Tribunal, including a point that should have been the subject of an appeal, is attractive but is, we find, wrong. 45. Although section 11 of the 2007 Act extends the right of appeal (with permission and subject to excluded decisions) to an appeal “on any point of law” save for extraordinary cases, a party will not normally be given permission to appeal, and will not be expected to seek permission to appeal, a point that would not make a material difference to the outcome. However that party might still have very good reasons to respond to an appeal by arguing that the First-tier Tribunal should have dismissed or allowed the appeal for reasons other than those given in the Determination or rather for grounds which were unsuccessful in the proceedings that are the subject of the appeal. 46. Suppose a man seeks entry clearance as a husband and suppose that the Entry Clearance Officer finds that he has not shown that he can be either accommodated or maintained in accordance with the rules. A First-tier Tribunal Judge may decide, arguably wrongly, that the husband can satisfy the accommodation requirements but not the maintenance requirements. In that event the judge would dismiss the appeal. The Entry Clearance Office would have no interest in appealing. He is content with the decision to dismiss the appeal. The husband however may want to challenge the decision. He might want to argue that the decision that he did not satisfy the maintenance requirements was wrong in law and he may be given permission to appeal. In that event the Entry Clearance Officer may well want to argue not only that the decision that the husband did not meet the maintenance requirements was right but that the decision that he did meet the accommodation requirements was wrong. In short, without wanting to appeal the decision, the Entry Clearance Officer may want to rely on a ground that failed before the First-tier Tribunal. Rule 24 permits the Entry Clearance Office to give notice of his intention to raise such a point in a reply. In short rule 24 does have a meaning that does not depend on Ms Dubinsky’s premise and we reject the construction that she urged on us. Rule 24 does not create a right of appeal to a party who has not asked for permission to appeal. Rule 24 is not in any way to do with seeking permission to appeal and it is not an alternative to seeking permission where permission is needed. It is to do with giving notice about how the respondent intends to respond to the appeal that the appellant has permission to pursue. If a respondent wants to argue that the First-tier Tribunal should have reached a materially different conclusion then the respondent needs permission to appeal. 47. This is probably more significant in international protection cases than entry clearance cases because an appeal can be allowed on different grounds. An appellant may have shown, for example, alternatively, that he is a refugee, or entitled to humanitarian protection or that removal is contrary to his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The beneficial consequences of success would be different in each case. For example a person found to be entitled to humanitarian protection may want to argue that he should have been recognised as a refugee whilst the Secretary of State may want to argue that the appeal should only have been allowed with reference to article 8. In such cases both parties would want a result materially different from the one decided by the Tribunal and both should seek permission to appeal.” We must respectfully take issue with paragraph 37 of EG. Despite the mandatory nature of rule 21(2) of the 2008 Rules, there is no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly) or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7 (failure to comply with rules etc), so far as relevant provides: - “7.(1) An irregularity resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, does not of itself render void the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings.” (2) If a party has failed to comply with a requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, the Upper Tribunal may take such action as it considers just, which may include - (a) waiving the requirement; …” In Ved and another (appealable decision; permission application; Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC), the appellants applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal against a decision that their appeals to that Tribunal were not valid. The First-tier Tribunal refused to entertain the applications. The appellants then applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. The Upper Tribunal held that even though, for the purposes of rule 21(2)(b), the First-tier Tribunal had not refused, or refused to admit, the application for permission to appeal, it was appropriate to apply rule 7(2) so as to waive that requirement and enable the appellants to apply for permission direct to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal held as follows: - “24. On the particular facts of the present case, the requirement in rule 21(2), that the appellant should have applied for permission to the First-tier Tribunal and been refused or had their application not admitted, clearly should not be a reason to preclude the appellants from applying for permission to the Upper Tribunal. We would, however, emphasise the following important points. 25. … the existence of rule 7(2)(a) is not in any way to be regarded as excusing appellants from first applying to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal, before approaching the Upper Tribunal. Indeed, we cannot readily envisage a situation where the Upper Tribunal would be likely to accept an application for permission from a party to proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal who has chosen not to make any prior application to that Tribunal, whether or not such an application would be out of time. The same is likely to be true where no such prior application is made, as a result of inadvertence.” Although it is necessary to make that caveat to paragraph 37 of EG, the point made in paragraph 25 of Ved holds good, in the particular circumstances with which EG was concerned. The Upper Tribunal is very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a person who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that body seeks to challenge that adverse decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of the first-mentioned person. So far as the present case is concerned, we consider that the key question is what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” in paragraph 46 of EG. There is, we find, considerable force in Mr Amunwa’s submission that, in the case of the claimant, there was no material benefit to him in applying for permission to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge (as we find it to be) not to determine his human rights appeal, given that, on the face of the judge’s decision, the claimant had succeeded in resisting removal by reference to the 2016 Regulations. As a general matter, it would be undesirable if individuals were encouraged to seek permission to appeal against adverse decisions which, if decided differently, would confer upon them no tangible benefit, given the decision in their favour. The litigation of what in most circumstances would be academic issues is not in the interests of the overriding objective. In EG, the appellants would plainly have been in a materially better legal position, if they had been found by the First-tier Tribunal to have the status of refugees within the scope of the Refugee Convention, rather than persons who could not, for the present, be removed without a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment. They would have enjoyed the benefits of that Convention. We do not consider that the answer to the question of what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” necessarily turns upon whether (as here) two distinct appeals are in play. A paradigm instance exists in section 82 of the 2002 Act, where subsection (1)(a) confers a right of appeal against the decision to refuse protection claim, whilst subsection (1)(b) confers such a right in respect of the refusal of a human rights claim. A person who succeeds in a protection claim, on the basis that he or she is found to be a refugee or a person entitled to the grant of humanitarian protection, may have been unsuccessful in a human rights appeal brought by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. In such circumstances, there would be nothing to be gained by seeking permission to appeal in respect of the Article 8 human rights decision of the Tribunal. We accordingly conclude that the test of materiality, as articulated in EG and as further explained above, remains the correct touchstone in respect of the appellate system contained in the 2002 Act (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014) and in the 2016 Regulations. In the present case, therefore, the claimant was entitled to raise, in his rule 24 response, the Article 8 grounds on which he had been unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. That means it was unnecessary for those advising the claimant to couch this aspect of the response in terms of a “cross appeal”, with all the attendant procedural complexity that an application for permission to appeal would, at that stage, entail. It may be helpful to set out our general conclusions under this Part: (i) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (ii) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (iii) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (iv) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (ii) above). (v) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (vi) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (c) Disposal of the human rights appeal As will be apparent, once it is determined that the claimant can use rule 24 to challenge paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, that challenge must succeed. So much is common ground between the parties. The judge failed to make a lawful decision on the claimant’s appeal against the refusal of his human rights claim. The judge’s error was, in the circumstances, material. The decision in the human rights appeal is set aside and requires to be re-made. We have seen that, before the First-tier Tribunal judge, it was contended on behalf of the Secretary of State that the issue of whether the claimant could prove on balance that he is a British citizen was one which had to be resolved by judicial review proceedings. We did not hear submissions on what relevance, if any, the claimant’s assertion of British citizenship will have to his unresolved human rights appeal. A person who asserts that his or her removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and whose circumstances engage Article 8(2) of the ECHR, must succeed if the challenged decision is not one which can lawfully be made in respect of that person: Charles (Human Rights Appeal: Scope) [2018] UKUT 89 (IAC). At first sight, therefore, the issue of the claimant’s nationality may not be capable of being side-stepped. On the other hand, section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 entitles the Secretary of State to qualify the right of those who have the right of abode to live in and come and go into and from the United Kingdom, to the extent that “may be required … to enable their right to be established or as may be otherwise lawfully imposed on any person”. The Secretary of State might, therefore, contend that he is entitled to have an application for recognition as a British citizen determined in a particular manner, so as to resist its adjudication within the framework of a human rights appeal. This issue is one which requires adjudication at Upper Tribunal level. We have accordingly decided to re-make the decision in claimant’s human rights appeal. The parties are hereby directed to address this issue in their skeleton arguments, which shall be filed and served not later than 14 days before the resumed hearing. I. Anonymity Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions required the parties to make submissions as to anonymity of the claimant. We have considered the parties’ submissions. We find that the First-tier Tribunal judge was wrong to order anonymity and we lift his order. The judge’s reasons were that he considered it “in the interests of justice” to make an anonymity direction. (paragraph 2). The judge provided no explanation of why he had reached this conclusion. The starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. Applying the correct approach to the present case, we note the claimant has a partner, who was pregnant at the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal judge. The partner is not named in this decision. We are not satisfied that the claimant has shown that naming him in our decision would give rise to any material harm to the partner or any other third party. The claimant would, no doubt, prefer it if our decision did not refer to him by name. He is not, however, asserting a risk of harm to himself, as in the case of a person seeking international protection. Irrespective of whether the Article 8 rights of the claimant or any other person are in due course found to be of such a kind as to defeat the Secretary of State’s attempt to remove the claimant, the public has a right to know about the criminal behaviour of the claimant, which led to the decision that he should be deported. There is also a strong public interest in recording the fact that the claimant has repeatedly behaved in flagrant contravention of what is, on its face, a valid deportation order. The claimant’s request for anonymity is refused. J. Decision The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of errors on points of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the appeal under the 2016 Regulations is set aside and re-made by formally dismissing it. The decision in the appeal against the refusal of the claimant’s human rights claim is set aside and will be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. Signed Date: 24 June 2019 The Hon.

For the Respondent: Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. DECISION AND REASONS The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on 1 September 1977, appeals, with permission granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J M Hollingworth (hereafter the “permission judge”), against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke (hereafter the “judge”, to distinguish her from the permission judge) who dismissed his appeal against the respondent's decision of 14 November 2018 to refuse his application of 27 July 2016 for leave to remain on the basis of his right to his private life in the United Kingdom. The hearing before the judge took place on 22 January 2019. In AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal (Lane J, President, and Upper Tribunal Judge Blum) gave guidance on when it would be appropriate to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a ground that was not advanced by the applicant. The decision in AZ was published on 21 September 2018. The permission judge signed his decision on 3 April 2019. He therefore had the benefit of the guidance in AZ. Immigration history The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2007 with leave as a student. He had leave as a student from 13 April 2007 until 30 April 2011 and from 21 January 2015 until 18 February 2016. On 17 March 2016, he made an application for leave to remain on compassionate grounds outside the Immigration Rules. The application was refused on 20 July 2016 without a right of appeal. On 27 July 2016, he requested the respondent to reconsider his application on human rights grounds. This is the request that was the subject of the decision of 14 November 2018 which gave the appellant a right of appeal. The judge's decision An expert report from Dr Bashir, Consultant Psychiatrist, was submitted to the judge. The report stated that the appellant had suffered from severe clinical depression. Ms Ukachi-Lois, who appeared for the appellant before the judge, informed the judge that she did not rely upon the appellant’s ill-health. However, the judge said ([5]) that some references were made to it during submissions. The judge considered the appellant’s private life claim under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules and concluded that he had not shown that there would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria. She noted that the appellant relied upon his lack of family members in Nigeria, his inability to accommodate and maintain himself if he was returned, and that he had suffered mental ill-health previously. In relation to the appellant's mental health, the judge noted ([7]) that Dr Bashir stated that the appellant suffered from severe clinical depression but she also noted that the diagnosis was not made with reference to any criteria. She noted that the appellant was referred back to his GP and that the medical evidence showed that he was last prescribed setraline on 21 May 2018. In addition, she noted that the appellant was not making a case based upon medical issues. In relation to the appellant’s claim that he would experience very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria because he had no family members in Nigeria and that he would be unable to accommodate and maintain himself in Nigeria, the judge took his case at its highest, on the assumption that he had no family members in Nigeria. She said, (at [8]-[9]): “8. The Appellant left his country in 2007 and if taking his case at its highest, and there are no family members there, and the house of the great uncle is not available to him now the uncle has died and the family members have locked it up, I go on to consider if he could return as a single male. 9. The Appellant came to the UK to study on [sic] the ACCA but did not complete the professional level because of ill-health. He told me he would like to complete his studies and I see no reason why he could not return to his country and either continue his studies there or make an out of country application to continue in the UK if this is what he so wishes. The aunt houses and maintains him and she said it would be too costly for her to continue to maintain him if he returned to Nigeria and lived there and for her to pay for his studies. I note the Appellant and his aunt appear not to have considered the option of him returning to his country and taking some form of employment to maintain himself. I was told by both witnesses there are no jobs but there is no objective evidence to show he could not obtain some work, and in the initial months the aunt who has around £100,000 in savings and is drawing her pensions as well as working as a nurse on around two shifts a week and earning around £2000 a month is well-placed to assist him financially when he returns to settle in his country.” (My emphasis) The judge was asked to accept that the appellant lives with his aunt, Ms Theresa Chinyere Odum, in the United Kingdom in a family relationship. She also took this aspect of his case at its highest, and said, at [10]-[11]: “10. I was invited to accept the Appellant lives with the aunt in a family relationship, because she maintains and accommodates him and there is more than emotional dependency. Taking the case at its highest, if there is a family life and it would be interfered with if he returns to Nigeria, the aunt is from Nigeria and is now a British Citizen, but she returned there in 2017 for a funeral, and it would be proportionate for the Appellant to be removed to Nigeria because they could continue their relationship at a distance with her maintaining and accommodating him until he settles on his own feet. She can also provide emotional assistance to ease the transition and she can visit him as well. 11. I accept the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but he is now not suffering from such issues. He attends a church almost daily, but there are churches in Nigeria to attend and there is nothing to prevent him from such regular attendance there outside his work hours. The community of a church would also ease his transition to independence.” The judge then considered s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and proportionality. She said, at [12]-[13]: “12. The Appellant speaks English and I accept has been maintained by the aunt. However, he remained in the UK after his leave to remain expired, and he was not studying, and I do not accept his explanation for so remaining. He could have returned to his country and made another out of country application if he so wished. The Appellant only had precarious leave at best and has built up his private life when he had precarious leave. The Appellant has made a number of applications which were not successful since his refusal on 2 April 2013 with a right of appeal granted. 13. Therefore, drawing the strands together, the Appellant can return to his country where he lived until he was 29 years old. He has the benefit of some financial assistance from his aunt to ease him back to establishing himself before he can accommodate and maintain himself and he would not deplete her savings, and if he wishes he can continue to reside in his country or make another Tier 4 application to further his studies in the UK if he obtains the necessary offer from a suitable educational establishment. At present, he has no such offer because he has no leave to remain. For these reasons, it is proportionate and in the public interest for the Appellant to be removed.” The grounds and the grant of permission The appellant’s written grounds advanced two grounds, as follows: (i) (Ground 1) The judge made findings on family life but failed to consider the impact of the respondent’s decision on the appellant's aunt, contrary to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKH 39. Furthermore, she failed to give reasons or any adequate reasons for her omission. (ii) (Ground 2) The judge made perverse or irrational findings on a material matter; specifically, her findings that the appellant's aunt was well placed to assist the appellant financially when he returns to settle in Nigeria and that she would not deplete her savings. The grounds contend that there was no legal basis for these findings. The grant of permission went beyond the grounds. As I will need to deal with the terms in which permission was granted, I quote the reasons given by the permission judge for granting permission: “At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant living with the aunt in a family relationship. It is arguable that the Judge has attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the Judge at paragraph 11. The Judge accepted that the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but was now not suffering from such issues. It is arguable that the concept of real support fell to be considered against that background. It is arguable that the proportionality exercise has been affected in assessing the strength of family life and the consequences of the departure of the Appellant. At paragraph 12 the Judge accepted that the Appellant had been maintained by the aunt. At paragraph 9 of the decision the Judge has referred to the aunt stating that it will be too costly for her to continue to maintain the Appellant if he returned to Nigeria. It was arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis of the ability of the Appellant's aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria having proceeded at the conclusion of paragraph 9 to refer to the assets and income of the Appellant's aunt in evaluating that the Appellant's aunt would be well placed to assist the Appellant financially when he returned to settle in his country. It is arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis given the lack of reference to any obligations on the part of the Appellant's aunt or her financial commitments. At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant's aunt providing emotional assistance to ease the transition. It is arguable that if such emotional assistance was required to ease the transition a fuller analysis was required of the emotional assistance afforded to the Appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life.” (My emphasis) Submissions At the commencement of the hearing, I asked Ms Ukachi-Lois to draw my attention to the following: (i) the evidence that was before the judge to establish that family life was enjoyed between the appellant and his aunt; (ii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom; and (iii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the financial commitments and obligations of the appellant's aunt. I pointed out to Ms Ukachi-Lois that, given that the aunt had stated that she had savings of £100,000, her evidence that it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant if he were to return to Nigeria plainly called for an explanation. Concerning (i), Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. She also referred me to the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. Concerning (ii) and (iii), Ms Ukachi-Lois read to me her notes of the oral evidence that the aunt gave before the judge. I checked this against the judge's manuscript record of the oral evidence of the aunt. As a result, it was clear (and Ms Ukachi-Lois agreed) that the oral evidence that the aunt gave concerning the impact on her of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom was as follows: She would struggle to afford to support the appellant financially. She also said: “My savings were for many years, Not able to support. Schools on strike. Transportation and feeding would be too stressful. I am only family. 2008, Dad died. No family in Nigeria”. In relation to ground 1, Ms Ukachi-Lois said that she was in difficulty because there was a lack of evidence before the judge concerning the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. However, she submitted that it is only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant’s case can be made. In relation to ground 2, Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that the judge's finding that it would not deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially if he returns to Nigeria was irrational. This was because it would deplete her savings, contrary to the judge's finding. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the judge had noted at [10] that she had been asked to accept that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt. She took this at its highest. There was a paucity of evidence of any substance before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure from the United Kingdom. At [12], the judge accepted that the appellant had been maintained by his aunt in the United Kingdom. She noted that there was no explanation for the appellant remaining in the United Kingdom once his leave had expired. At [8], the judge considered, at its highest, the appellant's claim that he has no family in Nigeria. Mr Clarke submitted that, given the case that was advanced before the judge and the evidence that was before her, ground 1 is simply not established. Mr Clarke submitted that ground 2 was a perversity challenge. i.e. that no properly directed Tribunal could reach the same conclusion on the basis of the evidence that was before the judge. It was not the case, as portrayed in the grounds, that the judge had made her decision on the basis that the appellant’s aunt would support the appellant indefinitely. In Mr Clarke’s submission, it was clear from [9] of the judge’s decision that she considered that the appellant would be able to obtain a job to maintain himself and that his aunt would only need to provide him with financial assistance in the initial months, whilst he settled down. Accordingly, he submitted that it was open to the judge to find that it would not deplete the savings of the appellant’s aunt if she were to provide the appellant with such financial assistance in the initial months. She was accommodating and maintaining him at present, in any event. Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that, if I were to set aside the judge's decision, the Upper Tribunal could re-make the decision on the appeal. However, given the paucity of the evidence that was before the judge, she requested that the appellant be given an opportunity to provide further evidence about his aunt's financial circumstances. I reserved my decision. Assessment Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence that was before the judge to establish that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt was the fact that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. It is clear from [10] that the judge decided the appellant's appeal taking his claim that he enjoyed family life with his aunt at its highest. She found that they could continue their relationship with each other at a distance. That finding was fully open to her, given the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. She said in her witness statement that she brought the appellant to the United Kingdom in 2007, when he was 29/30 years old, so that he could study accountancy and achieve an ACCA qualification. Accordingly, their enjoyment of their relationship with each other over many years, from his birth until he was 29/30 years old, was from a distance. Ground 1, which contends that the judge had erred by failing to consider the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure, cannot succeed because it was plain at the hearing before me that Ms Ukachi-Lois was in difficulty referring me to any evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant's aunt. I have set out that evidence at my para 14 above. It is plain that the judge specifically considered, at [9], the aunt’s evidence that it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant in Nigeria and pay for his studies. She said that neither the appellant nor his aunt had considered the possibility of the appellant obtaining a job in Nigeria and that, although both witnesses told her that there were no jobs in Nigeria, there was no objective evidence to show that he could not obtain some work. I stress that, apart from the evidence set out at my para 14 above, which the judge considered at [9], there was simply no evidence before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. The judge assessed such evidence as was before her. Ms Ukachi-Lois was relegated to submitting that it was only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant's case can be made. However, the judge has made a fair assessment of such evidence as was before her. This submission just ignores the fact that the judge's decision can only be set aside if she has made an error on a point of law such that it should be set aside. I therefore reject ground 1. Ground 2 is likewise hopeless. It simply ignores the judge's reasoning, that there was no objective evidence that the appellant could not obtain some work in Nigeria and that, in the initial months, the aunt was well placed financially to assist him to settle in his country. Furthermore, and as I said at the hearing, the evidence of the appellant's aunt, that it would be too costly for her to maintain him and pay for his studies, plainly called for an explanation given that she had savings of £100,000. This is a large sum of money. Few people of ordinary means have access to such savings. Since it was for the appellant to establish his case, it was for him to provide evidence to show precisely why it would be too costly for his aunt to help him to settle down in Nigeria, whether or not he pursued his studies there, and that the financial cost of her doing so was such that the decision was disproportionate. It is clear that the aunt was not questioned in oral evidence to explain why she said it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant, nor was she asked to give evidence of her liabilities and commitments. In her submissions at the hearing, all that Ms Ukachi-Lois could say in relation to ground 2 was that the judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted was irrational because it would deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially after he returned to Nigeria. However, the fact is that the judge found that there was no reason why the appellant would not be able to obtain a job in Nigeria and therefore that the aunt only needed to assist him financially in the initial period whilst he settled down. It is plain that she found, implicitly, that the aunt’s savings would not therefore reduce significantly. In reality, ground 2 amounts to no more than a disagreement with the judge's reasoning. The judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted, cannot be said to be irrational, on any legitimate view. I therefore reject ground 2. I turn to consider the grounds upon which permission was granted. Plainly, the grant of permission went beyond the grounds. In summary, it raised three points that did not feature in the appellant's written grounds, as follows: (i) that the judge arguably attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the judge at [11]; (ii) that the judge arguably set out an insufficient analysis of the aunt’s financial position given the lack of reference to the aunt's obligations or her financial commitments; and (iii) that, if emotional assistance was required to ease the appellant’s ‘transition’ after his return to Nigeria, then arguably ""a fuller analysis was required"" of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life. In relation to point (i), the permission judge went on to draw from the facts as disclosed in the judge's decision to support his view that it was arguable that the judge had attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship, stating that it was arguable that the concept of “real support” fell to be construed against the background that the appellant had suffered from some sort of nervous breakdown in the past. The authorities are clear that, in an asylum or human rights case, a Tribunal must take a Robinson obvious point in the claimant's favour. The term Robinson obvious derives from the judgment in R v SSHD ex parte Robinson [1998] QB 929. A Robinson obvious point is one that has a strong prospect of success. In AZ, the Upper Tribunal discussed the relevant jurisprudence at [61]-[74] of its decision beginning with Robinson. In head-note (3), the Upper Tribunal said: “3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal should be granted on a ground that was not advanced by an applicant for permission, only if: (a) the judge is satisfied that the ground he or she has identified is one which has a strong prospect of success: (i) for the original appellant; or (ii) for the Secretary of State, where the ground relates to a decision which, if undisturbed, would breach the United Kingdom’s international Treaty obligations; or (b) (possibly) the ground relates to an issue of general importance, which the Upper Tribunal needs to address.” However, the permission judge did not indicate that the grounds he was raising came within head-note 3.(b) nor can it reasonably be said, on any legitimate view, that they did. Since the points he raised were not for the Secretary of State, head-note 3(a)(ii) is inapplicable. This leaves head-note para 3.(a)(i), a Robinson obvious point in the appellant's favour. However, as the Upper Tribunal said in AZ, it is clear from the authorities that mere arguability is not sufficient. A higher hurdle must be surmounted. The point in question has to be obvious, in the sense of being one with a strong prospect of success, were permission to be granted. Even at the permission stage, the question is whether the point in question has a strong prospect of success and not whether it is arguable that it has, as is clear from para 3(a) of the head-note in AZ. The judge's decision did not mention what evidence was before her concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt. As can be seen from my para 13 above, Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. However, the judge was fully aware of this evidence and referred to it in her decision. There was no reason to think that she did not have it in mind when she considered proportionality. If there was relevant evidence concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt that the judge had overlooked, the expectation is that this would have been mentioned in the appellant's written grounds, whether or not he was represented. However, there was no suggestion in the appellant's written grounds that the judge had overlooked relevant evidence in this regard. It therefore appears that, in stating that the judge may have attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship and in referring to the need to consider the concept of “real support” in the context of the fact that the appellant had previously suffered a nervous breakdown, the permission judge in fact considered that the judge ought to have given more weight to the relationship than she did and to the fact that the appellant’s aunt had provided him with emotional support in the past when he suffered a nervous breakdown. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the permission judge was merely disagreeing with the reasoning of the judge. Furthermore, the authorities clearly establish that arguments as to weight do not ordinarily establish an error of law. Ms Ukachi-Lois (correctly, in my judgment) did not pursue point (i) at the hearing. It is plain that point (i) discloses no error of law in the decision of the judge. Point (ii) is that it is arguable that the judge had insufficiently analysed the ability of the appellant’s aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria given her failure to refer to the aunt's obligations and financial commitments. However, it was clear at the hearing before me, that there was simply no evidence before the judge of the financial obligations or commitments of the appellant's aunt. Furthermore, the aunt was not asked to explain precisely why she said it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant in Nigeria, which plainly called for an explanation in view of the amount of her savings, as I said at the hearing. Finally, point (iii) is that it is arguable that the judge had failed to give “a fuller analysis …. of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life”. This is an empty point as exemplified by the fact that Ms Ukachi-Lois did not pursue it at the hearing. For all of the reasons given above, it is clear that the three points raised by the permission judge were not only hopeless, they could not on any reasonable view have been adjudged as arguable Robinson obvious points, i.e. with a strong prospect of success. For all of the reasons given above, the judge did not make any error of law. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed. Turning to the grant of permission in AZ, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Holmes raised an issue concerning the delay (of about eight months) between the date of the hearing and the preparation of the decision. He referred to two cases on delay in his grant of permission: Mario [1998] Imm AR 281 and Sambasivam [1999] OATRF 1999/0419/4. However, the Upper Tribunal considered ([71]) that Judge Holmes had not correctly identified the relevant case law and that, in particular, he had failed to have regard to the more recent Tribunal authority of Arusha and Demushi (deprivation of citizenship – delay) [2012] UKUT 80 (IAC) which relied upon the Court of Appeal's judgment in RK (Algeria) [2007] EWCA Civ 868. The Tribunal said this at [70]-[71]: “70. The basic point to be borne in mind is that there must be an extremely sound reason for, in effect, compelling the parties to an appeal to engage with a matter that neither of them has identified. 71. The present case is an object lesson in what can happen when this principle of restraint is not respected….” In AZ, the Tribunal said (at [72]) that far from it being a case in which the ground raised by Judge Holmes of his own volition was strongly arguable, it was not a ground at all. This can certainly be said of point (i) raised by the permission judge in the instant case, because issues going to weight rarely give rise to an error of law, as has been said on many occasions (for example, Blake J, the then President, in Green (Article 8 – new rules) [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC)). It is difficult to see what error of law the permission judge had in mind in relation to point (iii) above which was not even pursued by Ms Ukachi-Lois at the hearing. However, the position is even worse in relation to point (ii). This is because the evidence which necessarily would have had to have been adduced to the judge in order to make good this point had not even been adduced. There was simply no evidence before the judge which could have enabled her to conduct any analysis of the financial commitments of the appellant's aunt. At para 70 of AZ, the Tribunal said that there must be an extremely sound reason for compelling the parties to engage with a matter that neither had identified. In the instant case, two of the three points were not even pursued at the hearing and one could not be established because the evidence necessary to establish the point was simply not before the judge. It is important to bear in mind that a grant of permission when it is not properly warranted wastes the limited resources of the Upper Tribunal, puts the parties to unnecessary expense, delays bringing finality to the case in question and contributes to delaying the disposition of other meritorious cases. It is therefore necessary to exercise self-restraint, as the Tribunal said in AZ. The following points of general guidance emerge from the instant case: (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ, the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. Decision There was no error of law in the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke. Accordingly, the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal against the respondent decision stands.  Signed Date: 6 June 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Gill",2019-06-07
3,RP/00159/2017," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: RP/00159/2017 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS At Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated:  on 07.01 & 11.04.2019 On 03.06.2019   Before: Upper Tribunal Judge John FREEMAN and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Toby DAVEY (on 11 April) Between: Gezim [M] appellant and Secretary of State for the Home Department respondent Representation: On 7 January: for the appellant: Joanne Rothwell (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Toby Lindsay On 11 April: for the appellant: Alison Harvey (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Tony Melvin DETERMINATION AND REASONS This is an appeal, by the respondent to the original appeal, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fiona Beach), sitting at Taylor House on 28 September 2018, to allow a revocation of protection appeal by a citizen of Kosovo, born 1972. HISTORY The appellant came as a visitor in 1991, overstayed and in 1992 claimed asylum, which was granted in 1997, followed by indefinite leave to remain in 1999. He has a long-standing partner, [VD], also from Kosovo, but now a British citizen, and they have twin daughters, V1 and V2, born here on 27 May 2006. In 2002 the appellant himself applied for British citizenship, but failed to reply to Home Office inquiries, so was refused the following year. Between May and August 2014, the appellant and another man took part in a conspiracy to steal with persons unknown who were ordering electronic items over the Internet, for delivery on rounds where they were able to get the Royal Mail and Parcelforce delivery drivers to sign for the goods as if they had been delivered. Over £40,000 worth of them were stolen, and, as the sentencing judge pointed out, a substantial breach of trust was involved. This was particularly the case with the appellant, who had begun as a courier driver himself, but by this time ran a business, employing a number of others. In the judge’s view, no real distinction could be made between the defendants’ position and that of Royal Mail drivers, in terms of the absolute integrity required by their work. After a three-week trial in June 2016 the appellant and his co-defendant were found guilty, and on 6 July the appellant was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment, with slightly less for the other man. The judge noted the favourable things said about the appellant, including by a prosecution witness: he was very well-liked and hard-working, and had built up his business from virtually nothing. However, he was doing well at it, and not in want of money, except to support his growing business. His had been a leading rôle in a conspiracy involving breach of a high degree of trust, and sophisticated planning. This sentence was followed on 22 July 2016 by a notice of intention to deport, to which the appellant replied on 28 August. Next, on 5 October, came notice of the Home Office’s intention to apply the presumption set out in s. 72 (2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, allowing for his expulsion despite the grant of asylum. On 16 August 2017 the UNHCR indicated that they had no objection to this course being taken, subject to a full examination of the appellant’s individual case, and on 28 October 2017 a deportation order was signed, and sent with full reasons on the 30th. APPEAL TO DATE The appellant did not pursue any protection claim, so there is no need to discuss his conviction or its consequences any further, except to say that, despite his good conduct while in prison, and since, there is clearly a strong public interest in his removal, as Judge Beach recognized. She referred to s. 117C of the 2002 Act, and in particular to Exception 2, set out at (4). The appellant clearly had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with a ‘qualifying partner’ and both ‘qualifying children’: the question was whether the effects of his deportation would be unduly harsh on them. It is now clear that, in both her case and theirs (see RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), referred to in more detail below), at paragraph 8: “As a result of KO (Nigeria), the position is that, in determining whether Exception 2 (in section 117C(5)) applies, a court or tribunal is not to have regard to the seriousness of the offence committed by the person who is liable to deportation.” The judge found as follows: “76. it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s partner to stay here without him; but it would not be unduly harsh for her to return to Kosovo with him; 84. it would be unduly harsh for the children to stay here without him; and 87. so would it be for them to go to Kosovo with him.” Those findings were challenged by the Home Office, in rather prolix grounds (not drafted by Mr Lindsay), and permission to appeal granted by a first-tier judge, on the basis that there had been a lack of explanation as to why it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s family to go to Kosovo with him: as just noted, this was not a finding the judge had made in respect of his partner. This did not seem to me to be what the case was really about: the children are both British citizens, who have always lived here, and already at secondary school. They are both of course entirely innocent parties, and, irrespective of what conditions might await them in Kosovo, it must now be unduly harsh to send them there. I made it clear to the parties at the first hearing on 7 January that the real question in my view had been whether the judge was entitled on the evidence to find that it would be unduly harsh either for the children or their mother to stay here without the appellant. Her decision had also been challenged on that point, as not supported by the evidence. I considered this required reconsideration, for reasons which will shortly become clear; but, in fairness to the appellant and the family as a whole, I also agreed to receive a psychological report on the mother, when re-making the decision. The further hearing for that was adjourned on 26 February, when it became clear that this report would not be ready for 4 March, as promised, till 11 April. I also made it clear that I should receive further oral evidence, limited to events since the first-tier hearing. ERROR OF LAW The appellant was sent to prison on 6 July 2016, and, with the usual 50% remission, served 13½ months before his release in late August 2017. From then till the final hearing before me, he has been at home with his family for just over 18 months. At paragraph 84, the judge concluded her reasons on the children’s position, if he were sent back to Kosovo, in this way, after accepting, on the basis of the partner’s own evidence and the report of an independent social worker, that she was ‘emotionally fragile’: “The appellant’s partner could seek support from professionals but an intervention by Social Services cannot be considered to be in the children’s best interests particularly at a time when they will be bewildered and upset by their father’s deportation from the UK.” No doubt children who had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with their father would inevitably be upset by his deportation; but it has to be said that one significant reason for these children to be especially bewildered by it must have been that their parents chose not to tell them anything about its being a possibility till just before the independent social worker made her report. Of course this mistaken, if to some extent understandable decision cannot be held against the children; but the independent social worker’s report has to be read in the light of the situation the parents had created. The grounds of appeal referred to BL (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 357. There were a number of significant factual differences, including BL having been sent to prison for four years; but I was concerned with extracting the relevant principles, rather than trying to match up the facts. The common features with this case, which led to the passage relied on by Mr Lindsay before me were these: the appellant’s partner and children were all British citizens; she was said to have difficulty in looking after them without him (in BL, because she drank more than was good for her), and the Upper Tribunal inferred that they would descend into poverty and require the support of the social services. What the Court of Appeal said about that, at paragraph 53, was this: “As against this, however, [the partner] had looked after the family while BL was in prison or immigration detention and the UT had not made any findings that the family had then descended into poverty or required the support of social services, or that if that were to happen, there would not be adequate support services for these children. The UT were entitled to work on the basis that the social services would perform their duties under the law and, contrary to the submission of [counsel for the appellant], the UT was not bound in these circumstances to regard the role of the social services as irrelevant.” While the judge reached a number of other findings on the evidence, in my judgment her conclusion on this point had to depend on her finding at paragraph 84, set out at 10 above, which showed a very different approach from that prescribed by the Court of Appeal in BL. For this reason, I took the view that her conclusion on the children’s position at 84 could not stand, and still less what she said about the effect on their mother of staying here without him at 76. This is why the judge’s decision, detailed and comprehensive as it was, had to be re-made. MORE LAW Following the fresh hearing on 11 April, our attention was drawn to RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), and we invited submissions on it by e-mail. Following the passage already cited at 6, the Tribunal went on to reject the appellant’s argument that MK (section 55 – Tribunal options) [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) prescribed any general approach to the facts, in cases such as this. At 17, once again summarizing the effect of KO, they said this: “… the test of “unduly harsh” has a dual aspect. It is not enough for the outcome to be “severe” or “bleak”. Proper effect must be given to the adverb “unduly”. The position is, therefore, significantly far removed from the test of “reasonableness”, as found in section 117B(6)(b).” That is as far as we need go with RA, since the rest of the decision on the law is concerned with the interpretation of s. 117C (6), which was not argued in this case, where the appellant must succeed under Exception 2, or not at all (until much later: see 54 – 55). It follows from the previous citation that, having noted the facts of the appellant’s offence, and the factors in his favour as part of the background, we are no longer concerned with them, though we should be if this were a s. 117C (6) case. The effect of his deportation on his partner and children has to be considered solely in terms of whether it would be unduly harsh on them. This is a question for our judgment, to be exercised in the light of the citation just made, and no further reference to the authorities is required. FRESH HEARING: EVIDENCE We heard evidence from both the appellant and his partner [VD]: from now on we shall refer to her by her personal name only. Both also made witness statements, as did the appellant’s mother [N] and his sister [I], who live together in this country. There is a report about the children by Sally-Anne Deacon CQSM, an ‘independent social worker’ (20 September 2018, with an addendum on 27 February), and one about [V] by Dr Tracy King, a clinical psychologist (2 April). There is also a report from [V]’s GP practice, containing one entry, for 16 July 2018. Apart from school reports on the children, those are the main sources of evidence before us. The appellant Most of his first statement is concerned with his own situation: we do not say that as a criticism, but to explain why we are not going into more detail on it. He describes how [V], the children and his mother and sister all came to see him in prison three times a month, the most allowed; he also spoke to [V] and the children ‘every single day without a miss’. The appellant and [V] hadn’t discussed his real situation with the children, as they felt they were too young, but simply told them he was going away to work in an institution and would be away for a long time. He accepted with hindsight that this might have been a mistake, and in his oral evidence he also made clear that the children would have seen posters and other signs on their visits, making it obvious to them what sort of a place he was in; but that had never been mentioned. As for [V], the appellant thought she would be ‘devastated’ if he were to be deported; he had heard she had been taken to hospital with a panic attack when he went to prison, and was given intravenous medication. She had found it very hard to cope without him, ‘especially since they did not understand why I was not there for them’. She had improved since his release, but was ‘rather fragile’, and he was worried how she would cope without him, or what he was earning. In oral evidence, the appellant explained that he had had to guide [V] with a number of things on visits and calls, such as how to tax their car. She had coped; but on the basis that this was only a temporary situation. She had hated being home alone, ever since she was young (we shall return to her early life in dealing with her evidence), and, if he wasn’t there at night, would wedge chairs under their flat door for security, which the children found rather funny. The appellant said he had done his best to help the children with homework and school projects, and both he and [V] had encouraged them to value themselves as girls. Neither of them had ever smacked them, as parents tended to in Kosovo. Without his earnings, [V] wouldn’t be able to afford extras, such as tai chi (though the appellant’s sister had paid for this while he was in prison) or after-school activities or trips, and wouldn’t have the confidence to drive far (if she could still afford to run their car at all). For the present, his previous employers, who had given him a reference for his court case, and were clearly aware of his record and status, had been happy to have him back, and even promoted him. As for the family’s situation if the appellant had to go back to Kosovo, job prospects there weren’t good: 65% were presently out of work. The appellant’s work experience here had been in ‘social care and transport logistics’, neither of which existed there. If he did get a job, he gathered the average wage was €350 a month. (We may as well say right now that, while we have no doubt that an enterprising hard-working man like him could fend for himself in a country he knew, if that were our concern, we do not regard it as at all likely that he would be able to send any significant amount of money back to help his family). While the appellant’s only close relations (his mother and sister) were here, [V] had a sister, who lived in Kosovo, though she was also a Canadian citizen. That had meant they could visit each other, and they had done so probably about ten times over the 15 years the appellant and [V] had been together. On four or five of those occasions, [V] had taken the children to Kosovo. Usually they spent five or six weeks away, as [V] got the same long summer holidays as them: the appellant would join them for two or three, as and when he could get away from work. Often they would go on trips (more cheaply arranged from Kosovo) to the coast in Albania, or even to Turkey. They had last all been to Kosovo in 2014, and since he had been unable to travel, [V]’s sister had been to see them here. [V] [V]’s first statement gives considerable detail about her family history. She was born in Kosovo in 1973, and when she was only nine months old, her father murdered her mother: she was lying on the bed next to her at the time, and was told what happened later by her maternal grandmother. Her father suffered from schizophrenia, and spent the rest of his life in hospitals, till he died in about 2009. All the children were first taken in by their paternal grandparents; but later the grandparents found that too much for them, and [V]’s siblings were sent to live with other relations. [V]’s brother went to Spain when he was 18, and she has been in touch with him only once or twice a year, in brief phone calls, since she last saw him in about 2012. One sister (Sofie) qualified in medicine before the war, and went to live with her husband in Canada, where they are citizens; but, as Sofie’s qualifications were not recognized there, they went back to Kosovo later: he runs a successful business, while she practises medicine. [V]’s other sister ([B]) came with her to this country in 1998, and married a Spaniard. Unfortunately, after [V] met the appellant in 2005, relations between her and [B] broke down, and they haven’t been in touch at all for the last three years, even though they live quite nearby. This has also affected [V]’s relationship with Sofie, though she does not explain to what extent. [V] says the appellant was always a hands-on father, and would feed, bathe and put their daughters to bed when they were small. Since then he has taken them for all kinds of activities, and shared fully in the house-work. She says his love has made her very secure and confident, and would be devastated if she lost his company, though she would never lose his love. The appellant’s arrest had come as a complete surprise to [V], while she was on holiday in Kosovo: he had been with her and the children, but had returned the week before they were due to come back. She found the investigation and trial process so intensely stressful that she couldn’t even write down the contact details for him when he was sentenced, and his solicitor had to do it for her. The following morning she was having panic attacks, with breathing problems: she got a friend to take the children to school, and went to a hospital A&E department, where tablets failed to calm her down, so she was given an intravenous injection, which enabled her to come home that night, with the help of the appellant’s sister [I] (Lili). Afterwards [V] managed to cope, by reminding herself that the appellant would only be in prison for just over a year. They went to see him regularly, and found him very emotional; the girls were not told he was in prison, but clearly suspected it. After they were told, in advance of their visit to Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’), they broke down, and were crying all through their interview with her. Since then they have been less anxious, as for the moment their father is with them. [V] speaks highly of the appellant’s attitude to others, polite to everyone, and generous, particularly to drivers who worked for him. She was shocked and surprised by what he had done, but regarded it as very much out of character. [V] says the appellant’s mother [N] is old (now 74) and has too many health problems of her own to help anyone else. His sister Lili works long hours, and has decided to remain single: she is very fond of the children, but hasn’t got very much time to help with them; nor does she drive. The appellant’s English is much better than [V]’s, so he has always been the one to help with homework, and go to parents’ evenings. [We found the appellant’s English extremely good, and [V]’s more than good enough to give evidence in; as should be the case for both of them, given the length of time they have been in this country]. [V] says she is happy to take the children to Kosovo for holidays, but not for them to grow up there, for reasons she gives, and which we have already accepted. She says she is finding it increasingly hard to cope as the hearing date (for his first-tier appeal) draws near, and is taking prescribed medication. The appellant was dishonest, but didn’t think about the consequences to his family, or anyone else, at the time; but seeing them suffer has been so distressing for him that he would never offend again. [V]’s second statement (6 February 2019) covers a good deal of the same ground again. She is finding it hard to sleep, or to listen to her daughters when they want to tell her about their day at school. She doesn’t feel she is doing her best at work, though no-one at her school has complained. She does have the children skills which might be expected from a teaching assistant; but coping with her own daughters’ needs, in her present mental state, is another matter. In her oral evidence, [V] said she hadn’t been taking medication again after her visit to the A&E till last summer, when the first-tier hearing was coming up. She knew the appellant had received a notice of intention to deport in July 2016; but she had been coping from month to month while he was in prison. As for visits to Kosovo, the appellant had last come with them before his arrest in 2014: he used to come for part of their visit every year. In 2018 [V] and the children had been there for four or five weeks and stayed with her sister Sofie: her sister-in-law Lili had paid their fares, and the appellant, though he couldn’t travel, had encouraged them to go, as had her GP. Lili and her mother lived not far away, in Gospel Oak, but, as previously mentioned, were unable to give much help. The children were still going to their tai chi, and had started piano lessons just before the last New Year. They all saw Lili and her mother on a Sunday; but she didn’t feel up to having the children’s friends to stay over. [V] provided evidence of recent appointments with Komal Oza, a ‘psychological wellbeing practitioner’, with iCope, an NHS service to which she had been referred by her GP in February. Mr Oza says they had met once, and have five further sessions planned: [V] was suffering from low mood and anxiety, and he hoped to be able to give her some help and support; but he thought it likely that, owing to the lack of certainty around her and her family’s future, she would continue to experience these symptoms. [N] (the appellant’s mother) [N] sets out the family history in Kosovo, and how they came to make their way to this country in 1994. She is still suffering from her husband’s death in 2010, after 44 years of marriage. Now she is nearly 75, with ‘very high blood pressure’, dizziness and shoulder and knee pain. [I] lives with her, and looks after her, subject to work pressure. She was so upset during the appellant’s trial that her family had to send her to Kosovo for the duration, where she suffered from continuous chest pain. She says how dependent she is on the appellant’s help; but we cannot consider whether the effect of his deportation on her would be unduly harsh, so this is more relevant to the question of what help she, or [I] could give [V] with the children and things in general, if he had to leave. Of course she speaks highly of him, and of the children, and expresses the fear that “… the whole family will descend into some darkness”, if he had to go. [I] (the appellant’s sister) [I] has been a British citizen since 2002: she gives more of the family history, and her own, including her work record, and the breakdown of her marriage in this country. She received her psychotherapy diploma in 2008, and has since done voluntary counselling work for six years for one day a week. She works for a beauty products company. [I] does not give her age, but was clearly a young grown-up when she first came here as an au pair in 1987 – 89. She had been very shocked when she found out about the appellant’s crimes; but she says he is still visibly sorry for them. Besides other visits, he always comes round to see her and their mother on a Sunday, which is their special family day, when they took care to book prison visits. On the question of what happened while the appellant was in prison, [I] says this (paragraph 23 of her statement) I managed to somehow support my brother’s family while [he] was in prison, but it was with the understanding that it was going to be only for the duration of his sentence. I also experienced my fair share of emotional turmoil trying to put on a brave face while at work and with my family. It was extremely difficult because I was constantly delaying my duties … sometimes calling in sick just so I can stay at home to recover my energy or even just simply by crying to myself on my own. [I] goes on to say that, much as she loves the children, she would never be able fully to support them, emotionally or financially, as she doesn’t earn enough, and sometimes has to travel for her work. She is afraid the responsibility in itself of taking her brother’s place would be too much for her. [I] explains the effect of what happened on her and her mother: As a result of [V]’s condition my mother and I rallied round and helped every day the best way we could. It was not easy, because all of us carried our own share of distress. We were in a constant state of just surviving every day the best way we could. They hadn’t known how to explain to the girls, then only ten, that their father faced deportation. Dr King (the clinical psychologist) Dr King’s very recent, long, discursive and somewhat repetitive report on [V] was of course not before the judge. She gives her assessment of her as suffering from the following personality disorders: Dependent Personality Disorder (over-reliance on others to meet emotional and physical needs, hard to make decisions without excessive advice from others, passivity, fear of being left alone to care for self, devastated by separation and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship). Avoidant Personality Style (extreme inhibition, inadequacy and sensitivity to negative criticism and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship), and Schizoid Personality Style (solitary habits, emotional distance difficulties expressing emotion) Dr King’s answers to the questions about [V] she was asked by the appellant’s solicitors were as follows (mostly summarized by us): Is she suffering from any known psychological conditions that have affected her mental health due to past experiences? See above, also Major Depression (recurrent, severe) and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Unusually dependent, self-effacing and non-competitive; lack of initiative and general avoidance of autonomy; vulnerable without support and sensitive to criticism; intensely needy of affection and nurturing; destabilized by finding out at the crucial age of 10 how she had come to lose both parents, with unconscious memories of the event itself ‘stored physiologically in the body’, reducing her mental resilience; exposed to the war in Kosovo, ‘females being particularly at risk’; high anxiety level apparently ‘suppressed to some degree with a functional level of depressive symptomatology to reduce the connection with the emotion of fear; any loss likely to trigger her unprocessed trauma and her early isolated life as a child; may withdraw from relationships if she fears rejection; lost older relations earlier than usual. Will try to appear calm, despite underlying fear; submits to the needs and fears of others to avoid rejection; “simple responsibilities may then demand more energy than she can muster; may feel life as empty, but draining, with weariness and apathy; may withdraw, depriving herself of support; fearful of humiliation and exclusion; shy, apprehensive and awkward; sees herself as “weak, fragile and inadequate and believes she is unable to meet everyday tasks without help”, minimal self-confidence, and puts herself down in the hope of reassurance. Disorientation and despondency indicate major depressive disorder; sensitive to ridicule and ‘worries that she worries’, giving the appearance of generalized personality disorder; daily apprehensive and short of sleep, tired, with aches and pains; restless, unable to concentrate, easily distracted and apt to fear the worst. If so, are these long-term and do they require sustained long-term treatment? Long-term treatment for at least two years required; at risk of frequent mental health instability till stabilized; even then at risk of relapses, owing to her age and the state to which her mental health has got. Medication likely to help, but anti-depressants will only manage some symptoms; needs personal therapy to build up her self-confidence and reduce her anxiety and low mood. Needs different approaches, such as Schema Focused Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing, less likely to be available on the NHS, and likely to cost about £100 a session for two years; current counselling will support her during that time, but will not deal with her underlying problems. Are these conditions likely to affect her day-to-day functioning and activities, such as ability to continue employment, study and running of the household and most importantly care of her daughters who are about to enter their teenage years and puberty? She will have difficulties in empathizing with and in setting in context her daughters’ concerns at their crucial age; at the moment her employer can cope with her having ‘bad days’; but this may not last, especially as she is working with special needs children, so she might lose her job; in view of her father’s reported schizophrenia, she might be at risk of genetic mental health trouble over time. She has a good relationship with the appellant’s mother and sister; but [N] needs support herself, and [I] can’t help with long-term support. This might mean her mental health got worse fast, and expose the children to neglect and isolation, for which she would be unlikely to seek help. In your opinion, how would the deportation of her husband exacerbate the psychological difficulties that she is experiencing today? Her dependent nature, there since her childhood experiences, is focused on the appellant, and would last for at least two years, at a crucial age for the children, when they would effectively lose both parents, one to deportation, and the other to mental health troubles. Deportation would be worse than when he went to prison, as it would be indefinite. She couldn’t see or speak to him so often, owing to the cost and safety concerns for women (and particularly the girls) in Kosovo. “Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident” [It is not clear how Dr King is able to give a professional opinion about this, on the basis of her very recent knowledge of [V]]. Explain or comment on her current difficulties that she is experiencing since her partner’s appeal was won, and then when the Home Office appealed, and the whole situation regarding the deportation has returned to square one. The situation for [V] is very difficult, as she was confident it had been put right, but then returned to the original very frightening situation. “This feeds into her sense of instability and lack of control and reinforces her sense of helplessness. These will create physiological responses in the body that are likely to directly trigger her early infant trauma of being present at her mother’s murder and her teenage trauma of being exposed to war in Kosovo. The deterioration evident is explained in prior questions with regard to her overall psychological formulation” Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’ naturally covers a great deal within Dr King’s expertise, and also covered by her; so we shall try to summarize her reports only so far as they add anything significant. They do not contain any summary of her conclusions, and reference to them is not helped by the lack of numbered paragraphs. We have already dismissed the possibility of the girls’ having to move to Kosovo, so that part of Ms Deacon’s evidence need not be considered. Clearly if they are to stay here without the appellant, then they must have their mother to look after them; so the question for us is whether it would be unduly harsh for them or her to have to stay here without him. While it is clear from Ms Deacon’s report that the appellant is a very good father, very close to the girls, and a provider, it is equally clear that [V] has “highly skilled levels of parenting”, as Ms Deacon puts it. Both girls are doing very well at school (as their reports show; and both were described as ‘exceptionally gifted’ to Ms Deacon by the head of their year) and equally well in their personal lives, as Ms Deacon’s report makes clear at p 17. So far as the direct effect on the girls of being without their father is concerned, Ms Deacon says this in her first report, at p 16 It is also argued that the girls could maintain contact with their father through regular visits to Kosovo and modern means of communication. However I feel that these methods are significantly inadequate and impracticable given [their] familiarity with their father’s physical presence, the positive nature of their attachment and the family’s anticipated lack of financial resources Ms Deacon had already given the basis for this conclusion, so far as the girls’ attachment to the appellant was concerned, and on that basis it can easily be accepted that keeping in touch at a distance, and on visits, would be very much less satisfactory for both them and him. At p 7, Ms Deacon quotes [I], who (she says) is a qualified child and adolescent psychotherapist, as saying that the appellant’s time in prison was … devastating for the children, but manageable with everyone’s support because it was short term and the girls were able to see their dad regularly. If this happens again it will be forever and the levels of abandonment that the girls would feel would have a significant effect on the future for them in terms of their identity, their mental health and their ability to fulfil their potential. We do not of course take this by way of professional expertise on the part of [I], talking about close members of her own family. Given the effect of KO, as set out in RA (see our 15), we take the view that the main question for us is not whether [V] could keep up the present standards of care for the girls on her own, without the appellant’s emotional, practical and financial support; but whether her ability to do so, without him, would collapse to the point of its being unduly harsh to her, or, even more importantly, them, for him to be removed. The answer mainly depends on Dr King’s evidence; but we shall look at Ms Deacon’s to see what help she can give on it. Ms Deacon gives her opinion (at p 16), disclaiming any specific professional expertise in this area, that the appellant’s deportation would appear likely to result in “a protracted, if not permanent decline in [V]’s mental health, which is likely to compromise her current highly skilled levels of parenting”. The evidence Ms Deacon relates in her first report, which is capable of supporting that conclusion, is already available to us from other witnesses: for example, at p 9, the appellant’s about her jamming their flat door with chairs if he is not there, and [I]’s about her lacking resilience and having ‘fallen apart’ while the appellant was in prison, and needing to be hospitalized. As we know from her own evidence (see 28), this did not last long. In Ms Deacon’s second report, she deals with the case under three headings, which do not entirely reflect the contents of what follows. Her first point (1) consists in a return to what happened when the appellant went to prison; then she goes on to consider the effect on the girls themselves of having to do without their father. In considering the ‘extreme and understandable distress’ they had shown, we shall need to consider, as she does not, the effect of the way the news of its possibility had been broken to them: see 29. That is the context for our consideration of what she goes on to say about them experiencing their father’s permanent absence “as tantamount to a parental death”. At 2, Ms Deacon again draws the distinction between the effect on [V] of the appellant’s permanent absence, as compared to his temporary absence in prison, and returns to the quality of contact that could be kept up between him, her and the children, for example by Skype, from Kosovo. She expresses the view that [V]’s ‘anticipated heightened levels of anxiety’ would force her to terminate her employment, in which case regular visits there would be beyond her means. At 3, Ms Deacon makes the point that teenagers do better with the support of their parents, and may take to drink, drugs or other vices if allowed to go astray. She notes these girls’ high performance at school, and ambitions for their future lives, and repeats the view that the appellant’s absence in itself would have “… potential to have catastrophic implications for the girls’ futures”, especially if [V] became ‘unwell’ without him. At 4, Ms Deacon notes the availability of social care; but she takes the view that this would be unlikely to be offered on a long-term basis as a protection need for the children, as they have an extended family who could take responsibility. This is slightly at odds with [V]’s own evidence about [I]’s commitments and [N]’s lack of capacity. Ms Deacon goes on to note the availability of voluntary support; but she concludes that this would be unlikely to be offered more than once a week, which would not be adequate. She has not informed herself on [V]’s take-up of mental health support; but again she speaks of “a significant delay in assessing this resource”, owing to nationwide demands. GP report This relates to what is described as a first depressive episode, which [V] came in with on 16 July 2018. By this time the appellant would have been out of prison for nearly a year, and was awaiting his first-tier appeal hearing on 28 September. Her history is given as ‘’depression with low mood, lack concentration, difficulty focusing, poor sleep’’: the context is given, and the only further potentially significant point is ‘’prev[ious] depression around time girls born, again, never self harm thoughts then either. Case due to be heard in September’’. [V] was prescribed the well-known anti-depressant Citalopram, and was to be reviewed in two or three weeks. It was noted “can self ref[er] psychology at any stage”: no doubt this was advice which had been given her at the time. There is then a final entry ‘crisis plans’: presumably this also referred to advice, but no further details are given. There is no evidence from the GP about any further appointments, or prescriptions; and no evidence of any reference by [V] or anyone else to a psychologist, until this was finally done in response to the application made by the appellant’s then counsel, on the basis of which I adjourned the hearing to 4 March, and then 11 April. (I was a little put out to see that Dr King dates her instructions only from 9 March; but Miss Harvey succeeded in reassuring me that something at least had been done before that). That concludes our treatment of the main sources of evidence, as listed at 17, so we shall now turn to the argument. DISCUSSION Both advocates made oral submissions at the hearing, and others in writing, in Miss Harvey’s case by e-mail, in response to the late submission of RA by Mr Melvin. Since these dealt with her general argument, it is convenient to take that first. Besides the ‘unduly harsh’ point, extensively discussed at the hearing, Miss Harvey relies on the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception under s. 117C (6), on the basis that the appellant … has lived lawfully in the UK for some 28 years, since 1 September 1992 and was recognised as a refugee from the war in Kosovo. The very long length of his residence and that, as a refugee, for many years the UK was the only country that he could call home are factors, taken cumulatively with those that bring the case within Exception 2, constitute very compelling circumstances. That is not an argument we can accept: if we had regarded it as arguable, then we should either have had to re-open the case for a third hearing, or else invite Mr Melvin to reply by e-mail. However, while the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception is open in a medium-sentence case, as made clear in NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662, this case was argued throughout before us, with good reason, on the basis that this appellant must succeed, if at all, under Exception 2. The version of the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument put forward in Miss Harvey’s e-mail here is ‘over and above’ Exception 1, if anything. Exception 1 was not argued before us, or at the first-tier hearing, for the good reason that this appellant, born on 28 December 1972, was already 28 years 8 months old when he arrived in this country, on 31 August 1991, and, following that, had spent only another 26 years and (nearly) 2 months here by the date of the decision under appeal on 30 October 2017, so had not been here for ‘most of his life’. The ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which will only become relevant if the appellant fails on the ‘unduly harsh’ point: see NA (Pakistan) at paragraph 36. Besides that, it is quite clear from the appellant’s own evidence that he has quite happily taken his family on holiday to Kosovo and nearby countries a number of times over more recent years, and is by no means a person whose only possible home is here now. Dealing with the present situation as we must, the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which could not in any case succeed on its merits. The other additional point of law taken in Miss Harvey’s e-mail is her reliance, in rather general terms, on the continuing validity of Strasburg jurisprudence on article 8. While no doubt she is right in principle on that, we were not in any case proposing to take any notice of the Home Office circular relied on by Mr Melvin, but to base our decision squarely on the ‘unduly harsh’ point, as laid down by Parliament, definitively defined in KO, explained in RA and argued before us. As already explained at 16, there is no need to go further into the authorities in this case: there is one question, for us to answer in what is described in MK as an exercise of ‘evaluative judgment’. Would the consequences of the appellant’s removal be unduly harsh, either for his children (directly or because of the effect on their mother), on on [V]? Dealing first with the direct consequences, we entirely accept that both the girls and [V] are particularly close to the appellant; in [V]’s case, perhaps all the more because of the continuing effects of her grisly early history (see 25); remote contact with him (by Skype or the like) could not replace face-to-face, especially for girls of that age; and they would all have a considerably lower standard of living without his income; the only direct relevance of this to the ‘unduly harsh’ criterion is that it would make it harder for them to go and see him in Kosovo. We do not accept that such visits would be completely impossible: [I] could no doubt give some help in finding the money for occasional tickets for the cheap flights which are on offer to Kosovo, as with many eastern European destinations, even if she is unable to take on any regular or continuing responsibility. Once there, [V]’s sister Sofie certainly could, and there is reason to suppose, given her past hospitality, would help with arrangements. The result is that, though the direct effects of the appellant’s removal on the girls remain something to be borne in mind on the ‘unduly harsh’ question as a whole, they cannot answer it in his favour on their own. The same would apply to the direct effects on [V], if they went no further than missing his practical, financial or emotional support. Sadly, as made clear in KO and a number of previous decisions, missing a father or a partner, even very much indeed, may be harsh, but is a normal, rather than an unduly harsh consequence of his deportation. In our view the key to this case is whether the consequences of the appellant’s deportation would go so far as to include what in ordinary language we should call a complete breakdown on [V]’s part. If they did, we should be prepared to accept that they would indeed be unduly harsh for her, and, because of their effect on her, for the girls; but not otherwise. Simply not being able to look after them as well as she does now would not be enough to make it unduly harsh for them. While that state of affairs would no doubt be extremely worrying for [V], we do not think that could be described as unduly harsh for her, unless, once again, it led to a complete breakdown. CONCLUSIONS As we have already made clear, the crucial evidence on this point is Dr King’s: from her 4.1, she had exactly the same sources of information as we do, with a three-hour interview with [V] taking the place of the oral evidence we heard from her. While we do not doubt the general validity of Dr King’s conclusions at 1 and 2 (see our 41), the most relevant questions for our purposes are 3 and 4. Bearing in mind that Dr King’s first-hand knowledge of [V] is so very recent (from their interview less than a month before the hearing), some detailed consideration of her recent history was clearly important. Dr King lists the GP report among her sources, and we should have expected some discussion at 3 of whether or not there had been any further visits to the surgery, or attempts to seek their help, or that of the NHS psychology service; and, if not, why not. We do not doubt that [V] was genuinely anxious about the appellant’s future when she saw the GP last July. It was clearly significant that she did so, and on the evidence before us only did so, when the first-tier hearing was approaching. The question is whether [V] went to see her GP because the uncertainty involved in that prospect had made her notably more anxious than she had been before; or because she wanted, or had been told, to get further evidence for the hearing? Similarly there was no attempt to get any further psychological help for [V] till after the Home Office appeal first came before me on 7 January, and Dr King’s involvement was forensic, rather than therapeutic. Only in February (see 35) did [V] get referred by her GP to Mr Oza, and any help he had been able to give her was at a very early stage, though he was not optimistic about the results. We have no evidence as to how the referral to Mr Oza came about, though the involvement of Dr King was clearly on legal advice, following the adjournment in January. We do bear in mind what both Dr King and Ms Deacon say about [V]’s reluctance to seek help, and we certainly do not regard the fact that she only did so on the occasions just mentioned as fatal to the contention that she would break down without the appellant, failing the two years or more of weekly treatment recommended by Dr King under 2. We regard her as an entirely genuine witness, and we have no doubt that her visit to her GP when the first-tier hearing was approaching was brought about by genuinely increased anxiety on her part. What the lack of any other previous attempts to seek help does mean, however, is that [V]’s likely response to being without the appellant has to be tested, so far as practical, rather than theoretical facts are concerned, to a very large extent on what happened while he was in prison between 1 July 2016 and late August 2017. Under 4, Dr King says this about [V] being without the appellant then Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident. However she could see him weekly and have daily telephone contact with him for support. There was also an end in sight for them to reunite. She therefore will not have felt so helpless or out of control as she does now. The last three sentences of that passage make perfectly good sense, and indeed correspond with findings we should have been prepared to make for ourselves on the evidence before us, including [V]’s live evidence, and rather anxious appearance as she gave it. However the language of the first (‘presentation’) tends to suggest a professional observation by the user, which of course was something Dr King had had no opportunity of while the appellant was in prison. There is a similar lack of investigation of [V]’s recent history (see 52) on the part of Ms Deacon, so far as she is qualified to give an opinion on the point we are considering; and she refers to her ‘hospitalisation’ at 48 without making it clear that it had only been temporary. Of course we bear in mind that the intravenous medication [V] was given when she took herself in to the A&E department had been a rather drastic intervention, and, in view of her failure to respond to the tablets she was given, no doubt a necessary one. However, [V] had been able to cope after that, though again we bear in mind that she was able to speak to the appellant every day, and see him every week. In the process she had to be talked through such ordinary details of organizing one’s own life as how to set about taxing the family car, to which she has now been introduced. Although the appellant refers to the anxiety (irrational in this country) which [V] had shown by jamming the front door with chairs every night when he was away, this now dates back nearly two years. More recently, she had felt able to leave the appellant at home here last summer and take the children to Kosovo for four or five weeks, though with the help of [I], who had paid for their trip, and they stayed with [V]’s sister Sofie. It is quite true that the girls, both 13, are now at a crucial stage in their lives, and that remains a relevant factor, though it does not in itself require their father’s appeal to be allowed (as made clear by the Tribunal in RA, in their treatment of MK). The other self-evident truth about them is that they will be growing up fast: as time goes on, they will need less support from their mother, and be able to give her more themselves. On that basis, the crucial period for the girls will last for a relatively short time after the appellant has to leave, if eventually that does happen. While [N] is unlikely, in view of her health, to be able to give any practical support, a grandmother’s wisdom and experience can itself be valuable. Though [I] disclaims any ability to commit herself to long-term support, she has, to her credit, shown herself ready and willing to make a valuable contribution by paying for [V]’s trip to Kosovo with the girls last summer. Neither Dr King nor Ms Deacon deals with this point: 13-year olds, and particularly girls are growing up fast, and the need for support for them and their mother cannot be assessed as if the situation were static. We bear in mind what Dr King says under 2 (see our 41) about [V]’s need for long-term help, and the limited value of what can be done in the short term; and also Ms Deacon’s views at 52 about the limited scope of help available from public sources. However, on the basis that the crucial period for the girls is likely to last for a limited time, [V] and the girls can all get useful help from [I], and [V] should be able to cope with such short-term help as she can get from her GP, social services, or the NHS psychology service (as she did without any of that, though with much greater opportunity for contact with the appellant, while he was in prison). That does not entirely deal with [V]’s own position, as she would no doubt still miss the appellant very badly, even after the girls had adapted to his departure. However, once she had got through the crucial period for them, we think she should be able to stay here with them for as long as they need her to look after them: while that may be for more than five years, it is likely to be less than the ten for which the appellant himself would be excluded, following deportation. We think the judge was right not to regard joining the appellant in Kosovo as unduly harsh for [V], for her own sake rather than the girls’. Once they no longer needed her living with them and looking after them, [V] would have the choice whether to wait till the appellant could eventually rejoin her here (which we see no reason why he should not, once ten years have passed); or to rejoin him in Kosovo. That would give [V] at least something other than permanent separation from the appellant to look forward to, and so we cannot regard the consequences of his removal as unduly harsh for her, for her own sake, either. On that basis, though the consequences of the appellant’s having to go will certainly be harsh for the whole family, we cannot, on the law as declared in KO, regard them as unduly harsh, either for [V] or for the girls. That is the starting-point for our consideration of article 8, and we have not been referred to any specific Strasburg or other jurisprudence or legislation which might make it inapplicable, or modify it in this case. The result is that the Home Office appeal must be allowed. We reach this conclusion with complete lack of enthusiasm: [V] and the girls are all British citizens, leading hard-working lives and, in the girls’ cases, potentially valuable ones to society outside their own family. They are all innocent parties, and the consequences for all of them will be harsh. RA makes it clear that the appellant is not entitled to rely on the result of the individual case in MK, as opposed to the principles set out in it, endorsed in KO; but we do note that the children in MK were only seven, so would go on requiring support for very much longer than in this case. Even the appellant, not that his interests are for us to consider, has always been a hard-working man, and, apart from becoming involved in crime, an excellent father and partner. He was an engaging witness, and we have no doubt he genuinely regrets his past dishonesty, if only for the harsh effects it has had, and may now go on having for his family. If we had had to consider only the proportionality of his removal to the public interest in the prevention of crime, without looking at it through the ‘unduly harsh’ test, then we might have reached a different result; but that is not the case.
