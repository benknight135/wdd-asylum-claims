0,[2019] UKUT 217,"R (on the application of Sutharsan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (UT rule 29(1): time limit) [2019] UKUT 00217 (IAC)In the Upper TribunalImmigration and Asylum ChamberJudicial ReviewNotice of DecisionThe Queen on the application ofNADARAJAH SUTHARSAN ApplicantvSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT RespondentThe 21-day time limit in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 for filing an acknowledgment of service in immigration judicial review proceedings begins to run on the day after the person concerned is provided with a copy of the application for judicial review, not on the day it was sent. A copy that is sent by post will be deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved.Decision of the Honourable Mr Justice LaneFollowing consideration of all documents filed, including the letter dated 21 June 2019 from the applicant's representatives, the Tamil Welfare Association (Newham) UK.The respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed within the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Reasons:1. The applicant contends that the respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed outside the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The respondent asserts that it was served within that period. If the applicant is correct, it is common ground that the respondent has not made an application, accompanied by the requisite fee, for time to be extended.2. So far as relevant, rule 29(1) provides that:-""A person who is sent or provided with a copy of an application for permission"" [to bring judicial review proceedings and who wishes to take part in them] ""must provide to the Upper Tribunal an acknowledgment of service so that it is received no later than no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal sent, or in immigration judicial review proceedings the applicant provided a copy of the application to that person"".3. The applicant says that a copy is provided to the person concerned on the date it is sent to that person. This means the 21-day period begins to run on the day after it was sent, whether or not the person to whom it was sent has received it.3. The applicant's position necessarily involves the proposition that sending and providing amount to the same thing. It is, however, evident from rule 29(1) that the legislature regards sending and providing as different. Otherwise, there would have been no purpose in SI 2011/2343 inserting the words in square brackets, which occurred on 17 October 2011, when UTIAC acquired jurisdiction to decide ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews. 4. Any doubt as to this is dispelled by reading the consultation paper and annexes, which the Tribunal Procedure Committee (TPC) published in 2011, concerning proposed changes to the 2008 Rules, consequent upon the assumption by the Upper Tribunal of jurisdiction in ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews (FCJRs)1. The annex attached to the TPC's consultation paper reveals that the original proposed wording of rule 29 read: ""? so that it is received no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal or in fresh claim judicial review proceedings the applicant sent a copy of the application to that person"". 5. The consultation paper, however, made reference to: ""CPR 58.8(2), which allows a total of 23 days for lodging an acknowledgment of service (2 days for postal service and 21 days from receipt of the application). Rule 29(1) allows 21 days for this to be done. The Committee is considering whether to make special provision for FCJRs that would maintain the 23 day time limit or to specify a shorter time limit given the nature of FCJRs""6. The TPC published a reply to the consultation responses, in which we find the following:""The majority of respondents suggested that the CPR should be replicated in order to avoid having different rules depending on the venue"". The conclusion of the TPC was that it ""agreed that it was appropriate to replicate the CPR time limit"". 7. The amendments to rule 29(1) that were eventually made in 2011 were, therefore, intended to reflect CPR 54.8(2)(a), which governs applications for judicial review in the High Court. CPR 54.8(2)(a) prescribes a period of 21 days ""after service of the claim form"" on the person concerned. The fact that service may not be effected until that person is put in possession of the claim form is made clear by CPR 6.14, which provides that a claim form is deemed to be served on the second business day after completion of what is termed the relevant step under rule 7.5(1). For posting by first class post, the relevant step is ""posting"".8. This legislative background makes it plain that the references to providing in the amended rule 29(1) were used in order to keep fresh claim judicial review (and, now, immigration judicial review) in step with the relevant High Court time limit. The applicant's interpretation, however, would entirely defeat this purpose.9. In Bhavsar (late application for PTA: procedure) [2019] UKUT 00196 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal examined the effect of amendments made by SI 2018/511 to rule 33 (Application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014. The amendments replaced the references in rule 33 to ""provided"" with references to ""sent"". As the Upper Tribunal noted at paragraph 26 of its decision, the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 stated that the replacement of the references was done ""in order to clarify that the time period for an application to be sent to the Tribunal is calculated by reference to the date on which the written reasons for the decision are sent to the party making the application"".10. At paragraph 28 of Bhavsar, the Upper Tribunal said:""Despite the implication in the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 that the substitution of ""sent"" for ""provided"" had been made merely in order ""to clarify"" the position, it is, in our view, clear that a substantive change had in fact been made. As a matter of ordinary language, a person is ""provided"" with a physical thing when he or she receives or takes possession of it. In the present case, that was on 22 June 2018, when the appellant's solicitors received the First-tier Tribunal's decision, along with form IA60. The fourteen-day time limit, accordingly, would have expired on 5 July 2018, but for the amendment to rule 33 made by SI 2018/511.""11. The account in paragraphs 3 to 7 above of how rule 29(1) came to be amended in 2011 underscores the correctness of what was said in Bhavsar. Serving and providing are not synonymous (see also: R (Javed) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 4426 (Admin)).12. It is undoubtedly the fact that something can be provided to a person in a variety of ways, which involve not only sending the thing via an intermediary, such as the Royal Mail, but also providing the thing directly by hand. If the applicant were correct in his assertion that sending a thing amounts to providing it on the date of sending, the applicant could unilaterally shorten the period of 21 days in rule 29(1) by choosing to send the copy application, rather than effecting personal service at the office of the respondent's legal representative, the Government Legal Department. Such an outcome cannot be correct.13. The references to providing in rule 29(1) are, nevertheless, not free from difficulty, in that the 2008 Rules contain no express provision like CPR 6.14, making it clear that a document sent by post by one party to someone other than the Tribunal is deemed to be served/received on the second business day after posting. In this regard, it does not appear that section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 applies (see Syed (curtailment of leave - notice) [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC)). It is plainly in the interests of the overriding objective in rule 2 to interpret the references to providing in rule 29(1) as including the position that a copy application which is sent by post is deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved. Pursuant to rule 2(3)(b), that is how the references will be interpreted by the Tribunal.14. In the application with which I am concerned, the applicant sent a copy of the application to the respondent on 29 May 2019. There is no dispute it was received by the respondent on 30 May 2019 and so deemed service does not arise. In view of what I have said above, it was on 30 May that the respondent was provided with the relevant document for the purposes of rule 29(1). The 21-day period therefore began to run on 31 May and ended on 20 June, which was the day that the acknowledgment of service was received by the Upper Tribunal.

1,[2019] UKUT 216," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Smith (appealable decisions; PTA requirements; anonymity) [2019] UKUT 00216 (IAC) THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 7 May 2019    …………………………………   Before THE HON. MR JUSTICE LANE, PRESIDENT UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GILL UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE FINCH Between THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Appellant and MORGAN HAYAT SMITH (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE) Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer For the Respondent: Mr B. Amunwa, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co Solicitors (1) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (2) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (3) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (4) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (2) above). (5) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (6) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (7) When deciding whether to make an anonymity direction, the starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Subject to statutory prohibitions on disclosure, any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. DECISION AND REASONS A. Introduction The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of Belgium, born in July 1988. He has a history of offending as a juvenile. As an adult, he was convicted in 2017 of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress; four counts of battery; assaulting a constable; and failing to surrender to custody at the appointed time. The offence of battery was committed whilst the claimant was on bail. On 15 September 2017, after considering the claimant’s representations as to why he should not be deported from the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State made a deportation order against the claimant. He did not appeal against that decision and was deported on 3 November 2017. Two days later, the claimant attempted to return but was refused entry to the United Kingdom. On 14 January 2018, the claimant was arrested by police, having entered in breach of the deportation order. The claimant was removed on 18 March 2018. The following day, he was encountered embarking on a ferry in Scotland. He was removed again on 7 May 2018. On 31 May 2018, the claimant again entered the United Kingdom, in breach of the deportation order. On 15 June 2018, the claimant was convicted of knowingly entering the United Kingdom in breach of the deportation order, for which he was fined. B. The decision letter Those acting for the claimant subsequently made representations, which the Secretary of State treated as an application for the deportation order to be revoked. On 19 July 2018, the Secretary of State explained why he had, in effect, decided not to do so. The letter took account of the claimant’s assertion that he had lived in the United Kingdom for the majority of his life, having lived here between the ages of 5 and 9 before returning to the United Kingdom in 2011 aged 12. The Secretary of State, on the basis of the evidence submitted, refused to accept that the claimant had been resident in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”), for a continuous period of five years. The decision letter noted that the claimant had “lost his temper on three separate occasions against 2 females and on those occasions, he in fits of anger assaulted both of them”. This included pushing his ex-partner by the throat until she passed out, after which he “continued to torment her by posting private and indecent photographs of her on the internet in order to humiliate her”. On another occasion, the claimant threw items around his flat, hitting his current partner with a wooden incense dispenser, as a result of which she was taken to hospital for treatment. He subsequently assaulted his current partner by slamming her into a bathroom mirror, before pinning her down on the floor and placing a blanket around her face and neck. The decision letter found that the claimant had a propensity to reoffend and represented a very genuine and persistent sufficiently serious threat to the public to justify maintaining his deportation. Having considered the issue of proportionality, by reference to the claimant’s submissions about difficulties he would face in Belgium, the letter concluded that it would be reasonable to expect the claimant to go to Belgium and resume his life there. The letter explained in detail why, in circumstances of the claimant’s case, his deportation to Belgium would not disproportionately interfere with his rehabilitation. At paragraph 58 of the letter, the Secretary of State concluded that deportation was proportionate and in accordance with the principles and regulations of 23(6)(b) of the 2016 Regulations. The decision letter then turned to consider Article 8 of the ECHR. Paragraph 59 reads:- “In addition to considering your client’s position under EU law and the EA Regulations 2016, consideration has separately been given to whether your client’s deportation would breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).” The letter noted the various elements of the claimant’s Article 8 claim, which were that he had a girlfriend in the United Kingdom, who was pregnant; that his mother remained in the United Kingdom; and that he had established a private life by virtue of his residence and education in the United Kingdom. So far as the claimant’s partner was concerned, the Secretary of State considered that the claimant did not have a genuine and subsisting relationship with her, in light of his conviction for battery against that partner. There was also no evidence of co-habitation. So far as private life was concerned, the letter explained why the Secretary of State did not consider that the claimant was socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. This was because the claimant was a persistent offender, having been convicted 8 times of 15 offences within a relatively short period of time in the United Kingdom and his “conviction history indicates an anti-social attitude towards the public and community and shows that he has not integrated into the United Kingdom society”. It was not considered that there would be very significant obstacles to the claimant’s integration into Belgium. At paragraph 79 of the letter, the Secretary of State undertook an analysis of whether there were very compelling circumstances, such as to make it incompatible with Article 8 for the claimant to be deported. For the reasons given, it was concluded that there were no such circumstances in the claimant’s case. Paragraph 84 of the letter concluded the Article 8 analysis as follows:- “Having carefully considered the facts about [the claimant’s] circumstances it is considered that [the claimant’s] deportation would not breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under ECHR Article 8 because the public interest in deporting [the claimant] outweighs his right to private and family life” Under the heading “Appeal”, the letter told the claimant that “you have a right of appeal against the decision under regulation 36 and 37 of the 2016 EEA Regulations. Information on how to appeal and the time limits for appealing are contained in the attached notice”. C. Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal On 3 August 2018, the claimant (who remained in the United Kingdom) filed a notice of appeal in the First-tier Tribunal. The grounds of appeal contended that the claimant did not meet the threshold for deportation of an EEA national with permanent residence and that his deportation would disproportionately interfere with his EU rights “and his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights, including article 8”. The case was heard at Harmondsworth on 15 October 2018 by Immigration Judge Lal. The claimant was present at the hearing and gave evidence, upon which he was cross-examined. The judge also heard evidence from the claimant’s mother and his current partner “who confirmed that she had been the victim of the [claimant’s] offending in the past but she thought that he had changed” (paragraph 60 of the decision). The judge found that the claimant had been in the United Kingdom for over five years and had acquired a permanent right of residence. The judge was satisfied that the claimant “did produce credible evidence of some insight into his crimes” and that he had “reasonably addressed issues of anger management, the impact of his actions on victims and how he would deal with those situations which he accepts were the cause of his previous problems”. The judge concluded that deportation on serious grounds of public policy/public security “are not made out”, finding that the claimant is “back with his partner and he has no links with Belgium” (paragraph 25). There was “credible evidence” that the claimant “has family life in the UK with his mother and that all his siblings and his partner are here and it would be disproportionate to expect [the claimant] to leave the UK at the present time” (paragraph 26). In the light of these findings, the judge allowed “the appeal against the deportation order” (paragraph 28). Paragraph 27 of the judge’s decision reads as follows:- “27. In the light of its findings above the Tribunal did not go on to consider Article 8 separately.” D. Challenging the First-tier Tribunal’s decision The Secretary of State applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the judge’s decision to allow the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. The grounds contended that the judge had been wrong to conclude that the claimant had acquired a permanent right of residence, given that “residence alone is insufficient” and there were no findings that the claimant had lived for the requisite time in accordance with the 2016 Regulations. That error infected the judge’s proportionality findings. The judge had also failed to have regard to Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations, wherein paragraph 3 was of particular relevance, given the claimant’s persistent offending. The judge had also, according to the Secretary of State, failed to give adequate reasons for the findings in respect of the claimant’s criminal offending; in particular, since the pre-sentence report considered the claimant to be at high risk of causing serious harm to women. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 1 November 2018, by reference to each of the Secretary of State’s grounds. On 24 January 2019, shortly before the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, the claimant’s solicitors filed a response under rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (“the 2008 Rules”). The response contended that the First-tier Tribunal judge had not erred in his conclusions in respect of the 2016 Regulations. The response also, however, contained what was described as a “cross appeal”, in which the claimant “hereby makes an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (directly) to cross appeal the determination of FTJ Lal in respect of the findings (specifically non-findings) in relation to Article 8 ECHR” (paragraph 16). The response went on to give reasons why the application for permission was being made out of time. As to this, the claimant:- “ … asks the Court (sic) to note that the [claimant] appealed on two grounds against the decision of the SSHD; firstly that the decision was in breach of EU Law and secondly that the decision breached his rights under ECHR. The appeal was allowed on the former ground and that therefore there was no benefit in him appealing the decision in relation to the latter. If it were the case that Appellant’s (sic) should appeal on all grounds (even less favourable) to which they have been successful on it will result in a chaotic administration of the Tribunal appeal system and contrary to the overriding objective in both the FTT and Upper Tier Procedure Rules” (paragraph 18). The response stated that the Secretary of State had made a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim and that an appeal against that refusal was, accordingly, before the First-tier Tribunal judge. It “was not open to him to just decide not to deal with it as he did in paragraph 27 of the determination and reasons”. The response explained that the claimant’s human rights claim was, in part, based on the fact that he contended he had an entitlement to British citizenship through his adopted British father. There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to support this contention, including an adoption certificate. The First-tier Tribunal judge, when faced with this submission, declined to deal with it. The relevant part of the judge’s decision is as follows: - “9. Mr Grennan [Home Office Presenting Officer] submitted that the proper remedy for the [claimant] was by way of judicial review and this of nationality (sic) had never been raised before. He urged the Tribunal to carry on with the appeal. 10. The Tribunal agreed with Mr Grennan as it was faced with an appeal against the deportation order. If it was to be now advanced that the [claimant] was not a national of the receiving country than that [sic] had to be specifically raised with the SSHD. It had not been done so in this case [sic].” F. Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal The appeal came before Julian Knowles J, and Upper Tribunal Judge Gill for hearing on 29 January 2019. The hearing was adjourned. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill gave directions on 30 January, requiring the Secretary of State to explain his reasons for failing to comply with earlier directions of the Upper Tribunal, which had required service of a skeleton argument. She also directed that the parties should file and serve skeleton arguments addressing, inter alia, whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, given that regulation 34(4) of the 2016 Regulations required an application to revoke an EA deportation order to be made from outside the United Kingdom; and whether the permission of the First-tier Tribunal/Upper Tribunal was required in order for the claimant to cross-appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge on the ground that the judge did not consider the claimant’s Article 8 claim. The adjourned hearing was heard by the present constitution of the Upper Tribunal on 7 May 2019. By that time, the parties had each served a number of skeleton arguments, speaking notes and applications. We found these documents of considerable assistance, supplemented as they were by the oral submissions of Mr Jarvis and Mr Amunwa. G. The jurisdictional issue The first issue is whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions of 30 January referred to regulation 34. So far as relevant, this reads as follows: - “Revocation of deportation and exclusion orders 34.- (1) An exclusion order remains in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A deportation order remains in force— until the order is revoked under this regulation; or for the period specified in the order. (3) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may only apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked on the basis that there has been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (4) An application under paragraph (3) must set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (5) On receipt of an application under paragraph (3), the Secretary of State must revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (6) The Secretary of State must take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” So far as appeals are concerned, regulation 37, again so far as relevant, provides as follows: - “37.- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person may not appeal under regulation 36 whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - (a) to refuse to admit that person to the United Kingdom; (b) to revoke that person’s admission to the United Kingdom; (c) to make an exclusion order against that person; (d) to refuse to revoke a deportation or exclusion order made against the person; … 37.- (2) Sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of paragraph (1) do not apply where the person is in the United Kingdom; and - …” The first point to observe is that neither the representatives nor the First-tier Tribunal judge appeared to have been aware at all of what is said in regulations 34 and 37. So far as the First-tier Tribunal judge was concerned, this may be because the judge considered, wrongly, that the EEA appeal was against the Secretary of State’s decision to make a deportation order against the claimant, rather than its being against the decision to refuse to revoke that order. This is apparent from paragraphs 3 and 29 of the Judge’s decision. It is also apparent that the writer of the Secretary of State’s decision letter was unaware of regulation 34(4), which – as we see - provides that an application to revoke a deportation order may be made only whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. Whether the Secretary of State is able to waive that requirement in such a way as to keep the resulting decision within the ambit of the 2016 Regulations is a moot point. It is, however, an issue upon which the parties did not make discrete submissions and, in the circumstances, we are not persuaded that it is appropriate for us to say more about it. Attention in fact focused upon regulation 37(1)(d) which, as we can also see, provides in terms that a person may not appeal whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against that person. The appellant was in the United Kingdom when the notice of appeal was filed. In Anwar and Adjo v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1275, the Court of Appeal considered the effect of section 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which, as then in force, provided as follows: “92. Appeal from within United Kingdom: general (1) A person may not appeal under section 82(1) while he is in the United Kingdom unless his appeal is of a kind to which this section applies. (2) This section applies to an appeal against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(c), (d), (e), (f) and (j). ….. (4) This section also applies to an appeal against an immigration decision if the appellant— (a) has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim, while in the United Kingdom, or ……” In Nirula v the First-tier Tribunal (Asylum and Immigration Chamber & another) and Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1436, the Court of Appeal explained that Sedley LJ’s judgment in Anwar had, in effect, been misunderstood: - “27. The question that arose in Anwar was whether a tribunal could proceed to a determination in a deception case if the appellant was inside the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State had determined that the appellant had obtained leave to remain by deception; on appeal the Secretary of State objected to the tribunal hearing the appeal because the appellant was in the United Kingdom. The tribunal decided it did have jurisdiction and, moreover, that the appellant had not obtained leave by deception. The Secretary of State obtained an order for reconsideration and, on reconsideration, the AIT decided that the appeal could not be pursued while the appellant remained in the United Kingdom and there was thus no jurisdiction in the tribunal to entertain the appeal. This court then granted permission to appeal to Mr Anwar as well as to another appellant (Ms Pangeyo) who raised the same point. By the time Mr Anwar's appeal came to be heard, the Secretary of State had agreed that he had not obtained leave by deception but since the case was ready for argument, both sides were heard on the question of jurisdiction ""at the court's request"" (para 9). ” 28. Anwar is therefore a considered decision of this court, contained in a reserved judgment, on the question whether a tribunal (then the AIT, now the FTT) has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against removal in a deception case when the appellant is in the United Kingdom. Sedley LJ (with whom Lloyd and Sullivan LJJ agreed) set out the facts, the statutory provisions and the issues, explaining how the first tribunal came to consider that they did have jurisdiction. He then proceeded to decide the jurisdiction point under the heading ""Jurisdiction"" 29. “…In circumstances in which this court has requested argument on a point about jurisdiction and has expressly decided that question, its reasoning must be treated as part of the ratio of the case. Mr Ockelton thought that because the point on jurisdiction had been taken in Anwar's two cases as per paragraph 23 above, the whole of the rest of this passage was obiter with the result that, had it been relevant to his decision, he could have disagreed with it because it was wrong. This is with respect a misunderstanding of the doctrine of precedent in two quite separate ways. In the first place, judges at first instance should accept a considered judgment of this court on a question of jurisdiction as a judgment that binds them. In the second place Mr Ockelton was able to decide (in my view correctly) that the point on jurisdiction had been taken in this case. In these circumstances his own remarks about what the position would be if the point had not been taken at all (or not been taken by the right person) were themselves obiter, as he himself acknowledges in his judgment. On the basis on which Mr Ockelton proceeded (namely that the views on jurisdiction in Anwar were obiter), it is not appropriate for a first instance judge to say obiter that considered remarks of this court are wrong. One consequence is a disruption to the body of authority by which tribunals are guided. If he believes that the view of this court is wrong, a judge of first instance should give permission to appeal. If this court where it falls for decision in an appropriate case considers the view to be wrong (and obiter) it will say so and first instance tribunals will know where they are. 30. Of course any decision of this court is only authority for what it decides and for any reasoning necessary for that decision. One thing that is immediately clear from paragraphs 19-23 of the Anwar decision is that nothing is said on the question whether the tribunal is entitled to take a point on its own jurisdiction of its own motion. That is a point which remains open for decision. It is not a particularly difficult decision. In my view any tribunal is entitled (and indeed well advised) to air any doubts it has about its jurisdiction and invite submissions on that question and then decide it. Anwar does not question that proposition in any way. 31. Mr Ockelton, however, thought (para 47(b)) that it was ""implicit"" in Anwar that the jurisdiction point has to be taken by the party affected and it is true that in paragraph 19 of his judgment Sedley LJ says that the point would operate in bar of the proceedings ""once the point was taken by the Home Office"". But that did not mean that only the Home Office could take the point: it simply reflected the fact that in the two cases before the court the Home Office had in fact taken the point. In any event there is an air of unreality in the suggestion that, if the tribunal takes the point, the Home Office does not. In the first place, the Home Office may not be represented before the tribunal; in that event it would border on the absurd to say that the tribunal cannot take the point of its own motion. If the Home Office is represented (as it was in this case), the representative will naturally permit the tribunal to make the running. If the appellant fails to persuade the tribunal that it has jurisdiction, it would again border on the absurd for the tribunal to have specifically to ask the Home Office representative if he wants to object to its jurisdiction to hear the appeal and to wait for an affirmative answer. If the Home Office does not think it fair or right to take the point it can always say so (and in a case such as Anwar it may have a public law duty to say so) and the tribunal can then proceed. 32. Mr Ockelton also thought (para 47(c)) it wrong to say that a failure to consider the issue of jurisdiction can give a tribunal a jurisdiction it would not otherwise have. Anwar does not so say. What it does say is that the Secretary of State can choose not to take any jurisdictional objection if she wishes to take that course, just as a defendant can waive his entitlement to plead limitation or, more likely, choose not to plead a limitation defence. If a tribunal gives a decision without anybody considering the jurisdictional position, the decision may be precarious but as Mr Ockelton himself points out in para 53 the decision stands until set aside. It will become less precarious once the time for applying for permission to appeal has expired. 33. Mr Ockelton also pointed out (para 47(a)) that there was no consideration in Anwar of the terms of the Secretary of State's Notice of Decision. In the present case the Notice of Decision does expressly say that Mr Nirula had a right of appeal which he could exercise ""After removal"". Mr Ockelton considered that, if it was necessary for the Secretary of State to take the jurisdiction point, she had taken it then. For my part, I agree with that conclusion but that does not in any way influence my decision that the jurisdiction point can be taken by the tribunal just as much as by the Secretary of State. 34. I would therefore reject Mr Malik's submission that the Secretary of State had herself to take the jurisdictional point and would hold that it was open to the FTT itself to do so. It made the correct decision on the point since it was clear that Mr Nirula was not abroad – he was actually in the room at the appeal hearing.” In the light of Nirula, it is, therefore, plain that, regardless of what occurred (or, more to the point, did not occur) at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal is entitled to take the “jurisdiction” point and that, if we conclude the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal under the 2016 Regulations, this was an error of law. Neither Mr Jarvis nor Mr Amunwa sought to argue the contrary. Instead, the claimant’s case for saying that the First-tier Tribunal did have jurisdiction rests upon the judgment of Michael Fordham QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, in BXS v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 737 (Admin). BXS concerned the effect of regulation 24A of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, which provided as follows:- “24A (1) A deportation or exclusion order shall remain in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked if the person considers that there been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (3) An application under paragraph (2) shall set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (4) On receipt of an application under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (5) The Secretary of State shall take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” Regulation 27(1) of the 2006 Regulations provided that: - “(1) … a person may not appeal under regulation 26 whilst he is in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - … to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against him.” The following provisions of the judgment of the deputy judge are relevant for our purposes: - “23. If, … the uncompromising language of Regulation 24A, which describes an exclusive route of revocation under its provisions and requires that an application must be out of country, were incompatible either with EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights, then I would have no hesitation in concluding that that uncompromising effect could not lawfully be visited on a claimant for whom it would be such a violation. Whether by reading in words or reading the provision down, there would in my judgment be no difficulty in arriving at that conclusion. There are no clear words of primary legislation (for the purposes of section 3 of the Human Rights Act) that would mandate the maintenance of the otherwise uncompromising shape of Regulation 24A.” 24. What arises in the present case is a question as to whether the mere act of removing an individual pursuant to an EEA deportation order, so that they are placed in the position envisaged by Regulation 24A, is of itself a violation of their human rights. It is not difficult to think of examples where that action would plainly be a violation of human rights. The fact that the regulations permit the individual from abroad to apply for the deportation order to be revoked may very well be a good and perhaps a complete answer in most case when considering the implications of the ongoing exclusionary effect of a deportation order. But one can suppose examples of an individual who is not fit to fly, or examples of an individual whose family life will necessarily be harmed by the action of removing them, or by the necessary period of exclusion from the United Kingdom while they make the envisaged out of country application or pursue an out of country appeal. Circumstances of that nature can be envisaged in which that action of itself could constitute a violation of Convention rights. That being so, if Regulation 24A stood alone and were exhaustive of all remedies and rights of the individual, then there would, in my judgment, be an incompatibility with the human rights protections guaranteed by the Human Rights Act. In such a case, as it seems to me, the Secretary of State would only be acting consistently with her statutory human rights duty (under section 6 of the Human Rights Act) where the removal, of itself, could be said to be consistent with and not to violate those applicable human rights. That does lead to two conclusions. … 54. As for in-country appeal or out of country appeal, in my judgment, it must follow that if revocation can lawfully and justifiably be required to be pursued out of country, then it follows that insistence that any consequential appeal be out of country can also be justified. I ought to add that, in fact, as it happens, the out of country appeal position was already part of the EEA regime, not only from 2006 but, in fact, going to the previous Regulations of 2000. I ought also to add, in the context of appeal rights, that parliament has in section 109 of the 2002 Act recognised that different appeal provisions have been made in EEA cases than in non-EEA. None of that, of course, was to empower the making of provisions that were contrary to Convention rights. … 56. My answer to issue 1 then, for all those reasons, is that there is no incompatibility, either in EU or Human Rights Act terms, in the insistence, leaving aside the narrow human rights point which I have analysed, the insistence on an application for revocation based on change of circumstances and human rights and an appeal being pursued out of country, even though they would not be in a non EEA case. … 59. I ought to make it clear, at this point, that I do not accept the submission that the decision of 19 March 2013 was of itself an unlawful one in the light of the now recognised relevance that article 8 can have for a removal. The same is true of the letter of 28 March 2013 from UKBA. It is right that the Secretary of State was not at that stage considering the article 8 implications of the mere act of removal. Moreover, I have held that that is a proper human rights argument which an individual must always be entitled to raise and which engages the Secretary of State's section 6 Human Rights Act duty. However, the fact in this case is that the claimant's solicitors very clearly were invoking as the relevant provision, regulation 24A, and were inviting a revocation based on material change in the circumstances. In circumstances where that contention was rejected and in which I have held that the regulation which requires the application to be out of country is compatible both with EU and ECHR law, and in circumstances where the Secretary of State came later in the decision 15 November 2013 to grapple with article 18 and the question of removal, there is no ground on which the court could be justified in intervening. Nor, in my judgment, could there be any utility in the point so as to justify relief.” The Upper Tribunal accepts the submissions of Mr Jarvis, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that it is not possible to extract from the judgment in BXS any support for the proposition that, as a general matter, regulation 37(1)(d) of the 2016 Regulations should be somehow “read down”, so as to enable the present claimant to prosecute an appeal under those Regulations whilst he is in the United Kingdom. What concerned the deputy judge was the fact that there might be circumstances in which the mere fact of removal could violate Article 8 of the ECHR. As Mr Jarvis pointed out, however, regulation 33 of the 2016 Regulations requires the Secretary of State, when giving directions for removal, to turn his mind specifically to that issue, in circumstances where the individual concerned has not appealed against the EEA decision, but would be entitled to do so and remains within time to do so, from within the United Kingdom; or where the individual has so appealed but the appeal has not been finally determined. In the claimant’s case, the decision to remove by way of deportation was taken in 2017, when he was in the United Kingdom. The claimant did not challenge that decision. Furthermore and in any event, we have seen that the decision letter in the claimant’s case separately addressed the claimant’s submissions by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. The letter thus comprised two separate decisions; namely, a decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order and a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim. Section 82(1)(b) gives a person a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal where the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights claim made by that person. Section 84(2) provides that the ground of appeal is that removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Accordingly, the claimant was entitled, through the mechanism of the human rights appeal, to contend that his removal would violate Article 8, including (if it were the position) that the mere fact of his removal would constitute such a violation, irrespective of the outcome of his out of country appeal under the 2016 Regulations. In the light of paragraphs 29 to 39 above, we conclude that the First-tier Tribunal judge did not have jurisdiction to determine the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations and that he erred in law in purporting to do so. The notice of appeal filed in August 2018 was of no effect. We set aside the judge’s decision in respect of the 2016 Regulations and remake it by substituting a decision formally dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction. H. The human rights appeal For the reasons we have just given, the First-tier Tribunal judge was, in fact, seized of an appeal under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. That is accepted by Mr Jarvis and also by his colleague, Mr Wilding, in the latter’s skeleton argument of 12 February 2019. The position is, accordingly, exactly that hypothesised by Sales LJ at paragraph 30 of Amirteymour v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 353, albeit by reference to the previous legislative regime: “Depending on the facts, if the Secretary of State did happen to address Article 8 arguments in her decision letter in such a case, it might be possible to say that the Secretary of State had waived the requirement for an application form to be completed in respect of her exercise of her residual discretion under the 1971 Act by reference to Article 8 and that she had then made two decisions, an “EEA decision” in relation to entitlements under the EEA Regulations and an “immigration decision” within the scope of section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, with distinct rights of appeal under regulation 26(1) and under section 82(1) respectively……..” It would be desirable if, henceforth, the Secretary of State were to make it plain in decision letters of the present kind that he is not only deciding an application by reference to 2016 Regulations but also refusing a human rights claim under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. Such an approach may well have assisted the parties and the judge in the present case. As we have noted, the claimant’s grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal included a specific reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. That could only be taken as a challenge to the passages of the Secretary of State’s decision letter, where article 8 was expressly and extensively considered. Section 86(2)(a) imposes a duty on the First-tier Tribunal to determine any matter raised as a ground of appeal. At paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, however, the judge “did not go on to consider Article 8” in the light of his findings in respect of the 2016 Regulations. (a) Did the judge make a decision? Before us, there was some discussion as to whether paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision constituted a decision for the purposes of section 11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. This provision confers a right of appeal “on any point of law arising from a decision made by the First-tier Tribunal other than an excluded decision”. Mr Jarvis indicated that the Secretary of State might wish to reserve his position on this matter. With respect to Mr Jarvis, the answer is, in our view, manifest. In paragraph 27, the First-tier Tribunal judge was making a decision not to consider Article 8. That was a decision in violation of the obligation placed upon the Tribunal by section 84 of the 2002 Act. It would, we find, be highly undesirable if the position were otherwise. If a judge’s refusal to decide a human rights appeal cannot be categorised as a decision within the scope of section 11(1) of the 2007 Act, the only remedy will be judicial review. As the present case shows, such as a bifurcation of routes of challenge would give rise to complexity, delay and expense. It cannot have been Parliament’s intention, in enacting the 2007 Act, to bring about such a state of affairs. (b) Challenging the judge’s decision Having said this, how should the claimant have sought to challenge the decision in paragraph 27? Here, attention focuses on rule 24 (response to the notice of appeal) of the 2008 Rules. So far as relevant, this provides as follows: - “24. … (1)(A) Subject to any direction given by the Upper Tribunal, a respondent may provide a response to a notice of appeal. (2) Any response provided under paragraph (1A) must be in writing and must be sent or delivered to the Upper Tribunal so that it is received. (a) if an application for permission to appeal stands as the notice of appeal, (which it does here) no later than 1 month after the date on which the Respondent was sent notice that permission to appeal had been granted; … (3) The response must state - … (e) the grounds on which the respondent relies, including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another tribunal), any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely in the appeal; and … "" In EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal had before it a case in which the claimants had succeeded in the First-tier Tribunal on Article 3 grounds, by reason of them facing a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to Ethiopia, but where the First-tier Tribunal had dismissed their appeals on asylum grounds, on the basis that the claimants were excluded from the benefits of the Refugee Convention (and, likewise, from those of the Qualification Directive). The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission to appeal against the decision to allow the appeal on Article 3 grounds, following which the claimants filed responses under rule 24, in which they contended that their appeals should have been allowed under the Refugee Convention etc. The Upper Tribunal found as follows: - “33. Mr Eicke said that we have no power except that given us by statute and so we have no power to hear an appeal without permission. Parliament says unequivocally that a right may be exercised only with permission (2007 Act section 13(3)). An application can only be made in writing (First-tier Tribunal Rules, rule 24(1)) and an application for permission cannot be entertained by the Upper Tribunal unless an application has been made first to the First-tier Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Rules 21(2)(b)). Mr Eicke said that it made no sense for provisions that required permission to be obtained before a hearing in writing from a First-tier Judge to be swept aside and replaced by a system that enabled a respondent to an appeal to assert as of right arguments that were raised by the respondent in a notice of appeal which could otherwise only be raised with permission given in response to a written application. 34 Miss Dubinsky contended that appeal rights cannot be lightly displaced but we agree with Mr Eicke that we cannot give ourselves jurisdiction we do not have and it is not for us to create a right of appeal without permission. The claimants cannot appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal because they do not have permission to appeal and the Upper Tribunal has no power to give permission to appeal unless the First-tier Tribunal has refused permission (rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). 35. It does not follow from this that there are no circumstances when claimants would be unable to argue that any of the findings adverse to the respondent are wrong or that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by not allowing the appeal for more reasons than it did but the claimants cannot rely on rule 24 notices as an alternative to seeking permission to appeal. 36. Mr Eicke submitted that a rule 24 Notice was analogous to a Respondent’s Notice under rule 52 of the Civil Procedure Rules. There a party that is seeking permission to appeal from the appeal court must ask for permission and a party that (alternatively) wishes to ask the appeal court to uphold the order of the lower court for reasons different from or additional to those given by the lower court must give notice of that intention. His point was that the need for permission to cross-appeal was well understood in civil proceedings and seeking it was not something that the respondent to an appeal in the Upper Tribunal could be expected to ignore. 37. In many ways the provisions of rule 52 of the CPR are analogous to a rule 24 Notice but they are not the same. Under rule 52.3(2) of the CPR a party that does not have permission to appeal from the lower courts can seek it from the higher court but in the civil courts the failure to secure permission from the lower court (even if through culpable neglect) can be remedied by the higher court but the failure to seek permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal cannot be corrected by the Upper Tribunal. The First-tier Tribunal must decide a written application for permission to appeal before the Upper Tribunal can be involved (see rule 24(1) of the 2005 Rules and rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). This is a cumbersome procedure once proceedings have begun before the Upper Tribunal. An application in writing can be made at any stage, and a judge deciding a case in the Upper Tribunal could no doubt withdraw and determine a written application for permission to appeal as a judge of the First-tier Tribunal. However if the judge did not extend time (for such an application would almost always be very late) or refused permission to appeal there would no doubt be an application for an adjournment so that the papers could be put before a judge sitting the Upper Tribunal. This, we find, must be the deliberate intention of the rules and rather underlines the importance of a party that needs permission to appeal seeking it in accordance with the prescribe time scales and well before a rule 24 notice would ordinarily be appropriate. 38. Against this background we look carefully at the terms of rule 24 of the Upper Tribunal Rules. Although the rule prescribes a time scale for providing a respondent’s notice and prescribes its contents, the rule does not create a general obligation on a respondent to provide a notice at all. Rather if the respondent chooses to send a notice then rule 24 prescribes its content. In this case directions echo the rule and specify the contents of a Notice rather than insist on one being served. 39. Certain of the requirements are informative rather than controversial, such as stating the respondent’s name and address, whether the respondent wants a hearing and, usefully, whether or not the respondent opposes the appeal. Rule 24(3)(e), it was submitted, assists the appellant. It requires the respondent to state in the response: “The grounds on which the respondent relies including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another Tribunal) any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely on in the appeal.” 40. The 2002 Act provides statutory grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (see section 84(1)) but the Secretary of State can never appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and so cannot rely strictly on the grounds listed at section 84(1) which are all grounds of appeal against an immigration decision. It follows that “grounds” in rule 24 must have a wider meaning and include any reason relied upon by the parties to support the decision. It does not follow that a respondent can raise a point in a response that should have been raised in the respondent’s own appeal. 41. Ms Dubinsky argued that the rule 24 response permitted her to argue, without seeking permission to appeal, that the First-tier Tribunal should have resolved any point in the claimant’s favour that the claimant relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that this rule is incapable of being interpreted in a way that does not assume that a respondent can challenge a First-tier Tribunal’s decision in this manner without permission to appeal having been granted. Ms Dubinsky argued that a respondent who opposes an appeal can be expected, without need for express confirmation, to rely on grounds which were successful before the First-tier Tribunal. It would hardly be informative for an appellant before the First-tier Tribunal who succeeded in persuading the First-tier Tribunal (for example) that a decision was not in accordance with the immigration rules (section 84(1)(a)) to be required to state in a notice that it relied on the same successful ground when responding to an appeal brought by the Secretary of State and the rule makes no such requirement. Rule 24(3)(e) requires the respondent to state if it intends to rely on grounds that were unsuccessful “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” but intends to rely on in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that the rule does not make sense unless it is interpreted to mean, without qualification, that there is a right to say that a ground that was unsuccessful before the First-tier Tribunal should have succeeded. 42. When Mr Eicke addressed us on rule 24(3)(e) he tried to circumvent Ms Dubinsky’s submission by emphasising that the claimants were required to identify any grounds on which they intended to rely including grounds “on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal”. He said that the words “which are the subject of the appeal” are crucial. The proceedings which are the subject of the appeal were not, he submitted, all the proceedings that were before the First-tier Tribunal, but only the proceedings that were before us and the proceedings before us, were identified by reference to the grant of permission to appeal. Clearly, if he is right, the points relied on by the claimants are excluded because they were not part of that grant. 43. The bright line distinction between the First-tier section 85 appeal and the Upper Tier section 11 appeal suggested by Mr Eicke’s argument is inconsistent with the continuum suggested by section 104(4) of the 2002 Act and by rule 17A of the Upper Tribunal Rules. A section 11 appeal does not continue when a section 85 appeal has been abandoned. Similarly a section 11 appeal does not exist without regard to the section 85 appeal that encapsulated the dispute between the parties. In some ways this is an unattractive line of argument. It follows that we do not accept that the words “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” are limited to the grounds on which permission to appeal has been given. The “proceedings” that are the “subject of the appeal” are those that came before the First-tier Tribunal and it is those “proceedings” that are the subject to further appeal. 44. Ms Dubinsky’s contention that rule 24 is meaningless unless it permits raising any points that failed to impress the First-tier Tribunal, including a point that should have been the subject of an appeal, is attractive but is, we find, wrong. 45. Although section 11 of the 2007 Act extends the right of appeal (with permission and subject to excluded decisions) to an appeal “on any point of law” save for extraordinary cases, a party will not normally be given permission to appeal, and will not be expected to seek permission to appeal, a point that would not make a material difference to the outcome. However that party might still have very good reasons to respond to an appeal by arguing that the First-tier Tribunal should have dismissed or allowed the appeal for reasons other than those given in the Determination or rather for grounds which were unsuccessful in the proceedings that are the subject of the appeal. 46. Suppose a man seeks entry clearance as a husband and suppose that the Entry Clearance Officer finds that he has not shown that he can be either accommodated or maintained in accordance with the rules. A First-tier Tribunal Judge may decide, arguably wrongly, that the husband can satisfy the accommodation requirements but not the maintenance requirements. In that event the judge would dismiss the appeal. The Entry Clearance Office would have no interest in appealing. He is content with the decision to dismiss the appeal. The husband however may want to challenge the decision. He might want to argue that the decision that he did not satisfy the maintenance requirements was wrong in law and he may be given permission to appeal. In that event the Entry Clearance Officer may well want to argue not only that the decision that the husband did not meet the maintenance requirements was right but that the decision that he did meet the accommodation requirements was wrong. In short, without wanting to appeal the decision, the Entry Clearance Officer may want to rely on a ground that failed before the First-tier Tribunal. Rule 24 permits the Entry Clearance Office to give notice of his intention to raise such a point in a reply. In short rule 24 does have a meaning that does not depend on Ms Dubinsky’s premise and we reject the construction that she urged on us. Rule 24 does not create a right of appeal to a party who has not asked for permission to appeal. Rule 24 is not in any way to do with seeking permission to appeal and it is not an alternative to seeking permission where permission is needed. It is to do with giving notice about how the respondent intends to respond to the appeal that the appellant has permission to pursue. If a respondent wants to argue that the First-tier Tribunal should have reached a materially different conclusion then the respondent needs permission to appeal. 47. This is probably more significant in international protection cases than entry clearance cases because an appeal can be allowed on different grounds. An appellant may have shown, for example, alternatively, that he is a refugee, or entitled to humanitarian protection or that removal is contrary to his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The beneficial consequences of success would be different in each case. For example a person found to be entitled to humanitarian protection may want to argue that he should have been recognised as a refugee whilst the Secretary of State may want to argue that the appeal should only have been allowed with reference to article 8. In such cases both parties would want a result materially different from the one decided by the Tribunal and both should seek permission to appeal.” We must respectfully take issue with paragraph 37 of EG. Despite the mandatory nature of rule 21(2) of the 2008 Rules, there is no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly) or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7 (failure to comply with rules etc), so far as relevant provides: - “7.(1) An irregularity resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, does not of itself render void the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings.” (2) If a party has failed to comply with a requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, the Upper Tribunal may take such action as it considers just, which may include - (a) waiving the requirement; …” In Ved and another (appealable decision; permission application; Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC), the appellants applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal against a decision that their appeals to that Tribunal were not valid. The First-tier Tribunal refused to entertain the applications. The appellants then applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. The Upper Tribunal held that even though, for the purposes of rule 21(2)(b), the First-tier Tribunal had not refused, or refused to admit, the application for permission to appeal, it was appropriate to apply rule 7(2) so as to waive that requirement and enable the appellants to apply for permission direct to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal held as follows: - “24. On the particular facts of the present case, the requirement in rule 21(2), that the appellant should have applied for permission to the First-tier Tribunal and been refused or had their application not admitted, clearly should not be a reason to preclude the appellants from applying for permission to the Upper Tribunal. We would, however, emphasise the following important points. 25. … the existence of rule 7(2)(a) is not in any way to be regarded as excusing appellants from first applying to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal, before approaching the Upper Tribunal. Indeed, we cannot readily envisage a situation where the Upper Tribunal would be likely to accept an application for permission from a party to proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal who has chosen not to make any prior application to that Tribunal, whether or not such an application would be out of time. The same is likely to be true where no such prior application is made, as a result of inadvertence.” Although it is necessary to make that caveat to paragraph 37 of EG, the point made in paragraph 25 of Ved holds good, in the particular circumstances with which EG was concerned. The Upper Tribunal is very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a person who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that body seeks to challenge that adverse decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of the first-mentioned person. So far as the present case is concerned, we consider that the key question is what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” in paragraph 46 of EG. There is, we find, considerable force in Mr Amunwa’s submission that, in the case of the claimant, there was no material benefit to him in applying for permission to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge (as we find it to be) not to determine his human rights appeal, given that, on the face of the judge’s decision, the claimant had succeeded in resisting removal by reference to the 2016 Regulations. As a general matter, it would be undesirable if individuals were encouraged to seek permission to appeal against adverse decisions which, if decided differently, would confer upon them no tangible benefit, given the decision in their favour. The litigation of what in most circumstances would be academic issues is not in the interests of the overriding objective. In EG, the appellants would plainly have been in a materially better legal position, if they had been found by the First-tier Tribunal to have the status of refugees within the scope of the Refugee Convention, rather than persons who could not, for the present, be removed without a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment. They would have enjoyed the benefits of that Convention. We do not consider that the answer to the question of what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” necessarily turns upon whether (as here) two distinct appeals are in play. A paradigm instance exists in section 82 of the 2002 Act, where subsection (1)(a) confers a right of appeal against the decision to refuse protection claim, whilst subsection (1)(b) confers such a right in respect of the refusal of a human rights claim. A person who succeeds in a protection claim, on the basis that he or she is found to be a refugee or a person entitled to the grant of humanitarian protection, may have been unsuccessful in a human rights appeal brought by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. In such circumstances, there would be nothing to be gained by seeking permission to appeal in respect of the Article 8 human rights decision of the Tribunal. We accordingly conclude that the test of materiality, as articulated in EG and as further explained above, remains the correct touchstone in respect of the appellate system contained in the 2002 Act (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014) and in the 2016 Regulations. In the present case, therefore, the claimant was entitled to raise, in his rule 24 response, the Article 8 grounds on which he had been unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. That means it was unnecessary for those advising the claimant to couch this aspect of the response in terms of a “cross appeal”, with all the attendant procedural complexity that an application for permission to appeal would, at that stage, entail. It may be helpful to set out our general conclusions under this Part: (i) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (ii) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (iii) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (iv) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (ii) above). (v) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (vi) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (c) Disposal of the human rights appeal As will be apparent, once it is determined that the claimant can use rule 24 to challenge paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, that challenge must succeed. So much is common ground between the parties. The judge failed to make a lawful decision on the claimant’s appeal against the refusal of his human rights claim. The judge’s error was, in the circumstances, material. The decision in the human rights appeal is set aside and requires to be re-made. We have seen that, before the First-tier Tribunal judge, it was contended on behalf of the Secretary of State that the issue of whether the claimant could prove on balance that he is a British citizen was one which had to be resolved by judicial review proceedings. We did not hear submissions on what relevance, if any, the claimant’s assertion of British citizenship will have to his unresolved human rights appeal. A person who asserts that his or her removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and whose circumstances engage Article 8(2) of the ECHR, must succeed if the challenged decision is not one which can lawfully be made in respect of that person: Charles (Human Rights Appeal: Scope) [2018] UKUT 89 (IAC). At first sight, therefore, the issue of the claimant’s nationality may not be capable of being side-stepped. On the other hand, section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 entitles the Secretary of State to qualify the right of those who have the right of abode to live in and come and go into and from the United Kingdom, to the extent that “may be required … to enable their right to be established or as may be otherwise lawfully imposed on any person”. The Secretary of State might, therefore, contend that he is entitled to have an application for recognition as a British citizen determined in a particular manner, so as to resist its adjudication within the framework of a human rights appeal. This issue is one which requires adjudication at Upper Tribunal level. We have accordingly decided to re-make the decision in claimant’s human rights appeal. The parties are hereby directed to address this issue in their skeleton arguments, which shall be filed and served not later than 14 days before the resumed hearing. I. Anonymity Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions required the parties to make submissions as to anonymity of the claimant. We have considered the parties’ submissions. We find that the First-tier Tribunal judge was wrong to order anonymity and we lift his order. The judge’s reasons were that he considered it “in the interests of justice” to make an anonymity direction. (paragraph 2). The judge provided no explanation of why he had reached this conclusion. The starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. Applying the correct approach to the present case, we note the claimant has a partner, who was pregnant at the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal judge. The partner is not named in this decision. We are not satisfied that the claimant has shown that naming him in our decision would give rise to any material harm to the partner or any other third party. The claimant would, no doubt, prefer it if our decision did not refer to him by name. He is not, however, asserting a risk of harm to himself, as in the case of a person seeking international protection. Irrespective of whether the Article 8 rights of the claimant or any other person are in due course found to be of such a kind as to defeat the Secretary of State’s attempt to remove the claimant, the public has a right to know about the criminal behaviour of the claimant, which led to the decision that he should be deported. There is also a strong public interest in recording the fact that the claimant has repeatedly behaved in flagrant contravention of what is, on its face, a valid deportation order. The claimant’s request for anonymity is refused. J. Decision The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of errors on points of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the appeal under the 2016 Regulations is set aside and re-made by formally dismissing it. The decision in the appeal against the refusal of the claimant’s human rights claim is set aside and will be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. Signed Date: 24 June 2019 The Hon.

For the Respondent: Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. DECISION AND REASONS The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on 1 September 1977, appeals, with permission granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J M Hollingworth (hereafter the “permission judge”), against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke (hereafter the “judge”, to distinguish her from the permission judge) who dismissed his appeal against the respondent's decision of 14 November 2018 to refuse his application of 27 July 2016 for leave to remain on the basis of his right to his private life in the United Kingdom. The hearing before the judge took place on 22 January 2019. In AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal (Lane J, President, and Upper Tribunal Judge Blum) gave guidance on when it would be appropriate to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a ground that was not advanced by the applicant. The decision in AZ was published on 21 September 2018. The permission judge signed his decision on 3 April 2019. He therefore had the benefit of the guidance in AZ. Immigration history The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2007 with leave as a student. He had leave as a student from 13 April 2007 until 30 April 2011 and from 21 January 2015 until 18 February 2016. On 17 March 2016, he made an application for leave to remain on compassionate grounds outside the Immigration Rules. The application was refused on 20 July 2016 without a right of appeal. On 27 July 2016, he requested the respondent to reconsider his application on human rights grounds. This is the request that was the subject of the decision of 14 November 2018 which gave the appellant a right of appeal. The judge's decision An expert report from Dr Bashir, Consultant Psychiatrist, was submitted to the judge. The report stated that the appellant had suffered from severe clinical depression. Ms Ukachi-Lois, who appeared for the appellant before the judge, informed the judge that she did not rely upon the appellant’s ill-health. However, the judge said ([5]) that some references were made to it during submissions. The judge considered the appellant’s private life claim under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules and concluded that he had not shown that there would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria. She noted that the appellant relied upon his lack of family members in Nigeria, his inability to accommodate and maintain himself if he was returned, and that he had suffered mental ill-health previously. In relation to the appellant's mental health, the judge noted ([7]) that Dr Bashir stated that the appellant suffered from severe clinical depression but she also noted that the diagnosis was not made with reference to any criteria. She noted that the appellant was referred back to his GP and that the medical evidence showed that he was last prescribed setraline on 21 May 2018. In addition, she noted that the appellant was not making a case based upon medical issues. In relation to the appellant’s claim that he would experience very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria because he had no family members in Nigeria and that he would be unable to accommodate and maintain himself in Nigeria, the judge took his case at its highest, on the assumption that he had no family members in Nigeria. She said, (at [8]-[9]): “8. The Appellant left his country in 2007 and if taking his case at its highest, and there are no family members there, and the house of the great uncle is not available to him now the uncle has died and the family members have locked it up, I go on to consider if he could return as a single male. 9. The Appellant came to the UK to study on [sic] the ACCA but did not complete the professional level because of ill-health. He told me he would like to complete his studies and I see no reason why he could not return to his country and either continue his studies there or make an out of country application to continue in the UK if this is what he so wishes. The aunt houses and maintains him and she said it would be too costly for her to continue to maintain him if he returned to Nigeria and lived there and for her to pay for his studies. I note the Appellant and his aunt appear not to have considered the option of him returning to his country and taking some form of employment to maintain himself. I was told by both witnesses there are no jobs but there is no objective evidence to show he could not obtain some work, and in the initial months the aunt who has around £100,000 in savings and is drawing her pensions as well as working as a nurse on around two shifts a week and earning around £2000 a month is well-placed to assist him financially when he returns to settle in his country.” (My emphasis) The judge was asked to accept that the appellant lives with his aunt, Ms Theresa Chinyere Odum, in the United Kingdom in a family relationship. She also took this aspect of his case at its highest, and said, at [10]-[11]: “10. I was invited to accept the Appellant lives with the aunt in a family relationship, because she maintains and accommodates him and there is more than emotional dependency. Taking the case at its highest, if there is a family life and it would be interfered with if he returns to Nigeria, the aunt is from Nigeria and is now a British Citizen, but she returned there in 2017 for a funeral, and it would be proportionate for the Appellant to be removed to Nigeria because they could continue their relationship at a distance with her maintaining and accommodating him until he settles on his own feet. She can also provide emotional assistance to ease the transition and she can visit him as well. 11. I accept the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but he is now not suffering from such issues. He attends a church almost daily, but there are churches in Nigeria to attend and there is nothing to prevent him from such regular attendance there outside his work hours. The community of a church would also ease his transition to independence.” The judge then considered s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and proportionality. She said, at [12]-[13]: “12. The Appellant speaks English and I accept has been maintained by the aunt. However, he remained in the UK after his leave to remain expired, and he was not studying, and I do not accept his explanation for so remaining. He could have returned to his country and made another out of country application if he so wished. The Appellant only had precarious leave at best and has built up his private life when he had precarious leave. The Appellant has made a number of applications which were not successful since his refusal on 2 April 2013 with a right of appeal granted. 13. Therefore, drawing the strands together, the Appellant can return to his country where he lived until he was 29 years old. He has the benefit of some financial assistance from his aunt to ease him back to establishing himself before he can accommodate and maintain himself and he would not deplete her savings, and if he wishes he can continue to reside in his country or make another Tier 4 application to further his studies in the UK if he obtains the necessary offer from a suitable educational establishment. At present, he has no such offer because he has no leave to remain. For these reasons, it is proportionate and in the public interest for the Appellant to be removed.” The grounds and the grant of permission The appellant’s written grounds advanced two grounds, as follows: (i) (Ground 1) The judge made findings on family life but failed to consider the impact of the respondent’s decision on the appellant's aunt, contrary to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKH 39. Furthermore, she failed to give reasons or any adequate reasons for her omission. (ii) (Ground 2) The judge made perverse or irrational findings on a material matter; specifically, her findings that the appellant's aunt was well placed to assist the appellant financially when he returns to settle in Nigeria and that she would not deplete her savings. The grounds contend that there was no legal basis for these findings. The grant of permission went beyond the grounds. As I will need to deal with the terms in which permission was granted, I quote the reasons given by the permission judge for granting permission: “At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant living with the aunt in a family relationship. It is arguable that the Judge has attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the Judge at paragraph 11. The Judge accepted that the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but was now not suffering from such issues. It is arguable that the concept of real support fell to be considered against that background. It is arguable that the proportionality exercise has been affected in assessing the strength of family life and the consequences of the departure of the Appellant. At paragraph 12 the Judge accepted that the Appellant had been maintained by the aunt. At paragraph 9 of the decision the Judge has referred to the aunt stating that it will be too costly for her to continue to maintain the Appellant if he returned to Nigeria. It was arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis of the ability of the Appellant's aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria having proceeded at the conclusion of paragraph 9 to refer to the assets and income of the Appellant's aunt in evaluating that the Appellant's aunt would be well placed to assist the Appellant financially when he returned to settle in his country. It is arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis given the lack of reference to any obligations on the part of the Appellant's aunt or her financial commitments. At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant's aunt providing emotional assistance to ease the transition. It is arguable that if such emotional assistance was required to ease the transition a fuller analysis was required of the emotional assistance afforded to the Appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life.” (My emphasis) Submissions At the commencement of the hearing, I asked Ms Ukachi-Lois to draw my attention to the following: (i) the evidence that was before the judge to establish that family life was enjoyed between the appellant and his aunt; (ii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom; and (iii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the financial commitments and obligations of the appellant's aunt. I pointed out to Ms Ukachi-Lois that, given that the aunt had stated that she had savings of £100,000, her evidence that it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant if he were to return to Nigeria plainly called for an explanation. Concerning (i), Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. She also referred me to the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. Concerning (ii) and (iii), Ms Ukachi-Lois read to me her notes of the oral evidence that the aunt gave before the judge. I checked this against the judge's manuscript record of the oral evidence of the aunt. As a result, it was clear (and Ms Ukachi-Lois agreed) that the oral evidence that the aunt gave concerning the impact on her of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom was as follows: She would struggle to afford to support the appellant financially. She also said: “My savings were for many years, Not able to support. Schools on strike. Transportation and feeding would be too stressful. I am only family. 2008, Dad died. No family in Nigeria”. In relation to ground 1, Ms Ukachi-Lois said that she was in difficulty because there was a lack of evidence before the judge concerning the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. However, she submitted that it is only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant’s case can be made. In relation to ground 2, Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that the judge's finding that it would not deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially if he returns to Nigeria was irrational. This was because it would deplete her savings, contrary to the judge's finding. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the judge had noted at [10] that she had been asked to accept that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt. She took this at its highest. There was a paucity of evidence of any substance before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure from the United Kingdom. At [12], the judge accepted that the appellant had been maintained by his aunt in the United Kingdom. She noted that there was no explanation for the appellant remaining in the United Kingdom once his leave had expired. At [8], the judge considered, at its highest, the appellant's claim that he has no family in Nigeria. Mr Clarke submitted that, given the case that was advanced before the judge and the evidence that was before her, ground 1 is simply not established. Mr Clarke submitted that ground 2 was a perversity challenge. i.e. that no properly directed Tribunal could reach the same conclusion on the basis of the evidence that was before the judge. It was not the case, as portrayed in the grounds, that the judge had made her decision on the basis that the appellant’s aunt would support the appellant indefinitely. In Mr Clarke’s submission, it was clear from [9] of the judge’s decision that she considered that the appellant would be able to obtain a job to maintain himself and that his aunt would only need to provide him with financial assistance in the initial months, whilst he settled down. Accordingly, he submitted that it was open to the judge to find that it would not deplete the savings of the appellant’s aunt if she were to provide the appellant with such financial assistance in the initial months. She was accommodating and maintaining him at present, in any event. Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that, if I were to set aside the judge's decision, the Upper Tribunal could re-make the decision on the appeal. However, given the paucity of the evidence that was before the judge, she requested that the appellant be given an opportunity to provide further evidence about his aunt's financial circumstances. I reserved my decision. Assessment Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence that was before the judge to establish that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt was the fact that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. It is clear from [10] that the judge decided the appellant's appeal taking his claim that he enjoyed family life with his aunt at its highest. She found that they could continue their relationship with each other at a distance. That finding was fully open to her, given the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. She said in her witness statement that she brought the appellant to the United Kingdom in 2007, when he was 29/30 years old, so that he could study accountancy and achieve an ACCA qualification. Accordingly, their enjoyment of their relationship with each other over many years, from his birth until he was 29/30 years old, was from a distance. Ground 1, which contends that the judge had erred by failing to consider the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure, cannot succeed because it was plain at the hearing before me that Ms Ukachi-Lois was in difficulty referring me to any evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant's aunt. I have set out that evidence at my para 14 above. It is plain that the judge specifically considered, at [9], the aunt’s evidence that it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant in Nigeria and pay for his studies. She said that neither the appellant nor his aunt had considered the possibility of the appellant obtaining a job in Nigeria and that, although both witnesses told her that there were no jobs in Nigeria, there was no objective evidence to show that he could not obtain some work. I stress that, apart from the evidence set out at my para 14 above, which the judge considered at [9], there was simply no evidence before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. The judge assessed such evidence as was before her. Ms Ukachi-Lois was relegated to submitting that it was only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant's case can be made. However, the judge has made a fair assessment of such evidence as was before her. This submission just ignores the fact that the judge's decision can only be set aside if she has made an error on a point of law such that it should be set aside. I therefore reject ground 1. Ground 2 is likewise hopeless. It simply ignores the judge's reasoning, that there was no objective evidence that the appellant could not obtain some work in Nigeria and that, in the initial months, the aunt was well placed financially to assist him to settle in his country. Furthermore, and as I said at the hearing, the evidence of the appellant's aunt, that it would be too costly for her to maintain him and pay for his studies, plainly called for an explanation given that she had savings of £100,000. This is a large sum of money. Few people of ordinary means have access to such savings. Since it was for the appellant to establish his case, it was for him to provide evidence to show precisely why it would be too costly for his aunt to help him to settle down in Nigeria, whether or not he pursued his studies there, and that the financial cost of her doing so was such that the decision was disproportionate. It is clear that the aunt was not questioned in oral evidence to explain why she said it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant, nor was she asked to give evidence of her liabilities and commitments. In her submissions at the hearing, all that Ms Ukachi-Lois could say in relation to ground 2 was that the judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted was irrational because it would deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially after he returned to Nigeria. However, the fact is that the judge found that there was no reason why the appellant would not be able to obtain a job in Nigeria and therefore that the aunt only needed to assist him financially in the initial period whilst he settled down. It is plain that she found, implicitly, that the aunt’s savings would not therefore reduce significantly. In reality, ground 2 amounts to no more than a disagreement with the judge's reasoning. The judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted, cannot be said to be irrational, on any legitimate view. I therefore reject ground 2. I turn to consider the grounds upon which permission was granted. Plainly, the grant of permission went beyond the grounds. In summary, it raised three points that did not feature in the appellant's written grounds, as follows: (i) that the judge arguably attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the judge at [11]; (ii) that the judge arguably set out an insufficient analysis of the aunt’s financial position given the lack of reference to the aunt's obligations or her financial commitments; and (iii) that, if emotional assistance was required to ease the appellant’s ‘transition’ after his return to Nigeria, then arguably ""a fuller analysis was required"" of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life. In relation to point (i), the permission judge went on to draw from the facts as disclosed in the judge's decision to support his view that it was arguable that the judge had attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship, stating that it was arguable that the concept of “real support” fell to be construed against the background that the appellant had suffered from some sort of nervous breakdown in the past. The authorities are clear that, in an asylum or human rights case, a Tribunal must take a Robinson obvious point in the claimant's favour. The term Robinson obvious derives from the judgment in R v SSHD ex parte Robinson [1998] QB 929. A Robinson obvious point is one that has a strong prospect of success. In AZ, the Upper Tribunal discussed the relevant jurisprudence at [61]-[74] of its decision beginning with Robinson. In head-note (3), the Upper Tribunal said: “3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal should be granted on a ground that was not advanced by an applicant for permission, only if: (a) the judge is satisfied that the ground he or she has identified is one which has a strong prospect of success: (i) for the original appellant; or (ii) for the Secretary of State, where the ground relates to a decision which, if undisturbed, would breach the United Kingdom’s international Treaty obligations; or (b) (possibly) the ground relates to an issue of general importance, which the Upper Tribunal needs to address.” However, the permission judge did not indicate that the grounds he was raising came within head-note 3.(b) nor can it reasonably be said, on any legitimate view, that they did. Since the points he raised were not for the Secretary of State, head-note 3(a)(ii) is inapplicable. This leaves head-note para 3.(a)(i), a Robinson obvious point in the appellant's favour. However, as the Upper Tribunal said in AZ, it is clear from the authorities that mere arguability is not sufficient. A higher hurdle must be surmounted. The point in question has to be obvious, in the sense of being one with a strong prospect of success, were permission to be granted. Even at the permission stage, the question is whether the point in question has a strong prospect of success and not whether it is arguable that it has, as is clear from para 3(a) of the head-note in AZ. The judge's decision did not mention what evidence was before her concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt. As can be seen from my para 13 above, Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. However, the judge was fully aware of this evidence and referred to it in her decision. There was no reason to think that she did not have it in mind when she considered proportionality. If there was relevant evidence concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt that the judge had overlooked, the expectation is that this would have been mentioned in the appellant's written grounds, whether or not he was represented. However, there was no suggestion in the appellant's written grounds that the judge had overlooked relevant evidence in this regard. It therefore appears that, in stating that the judge may have attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship and in referring to the need to consider the concept of “real support” in the context of the fact that the appellant had previously suffered a nervous breakdown, the permission judge in fact considered that the judge ought to have given more weight to the relationship than she did and to the fact that the appellant’s aunt had provided him with emotional support in the past when he suffered a nervous breakdown. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the permission judge was merely disagreeing with the reasoning of the judge. Furthermore, the authorities clearly establish that arguments as to weight do not ordinarily establish an error of law. Ms Ukachi-Lois (correctly, in my judgment) did not pursue point (i) at the hearing. It is plain that point (i) discloses no error of law in the decision of the judge. Point (ii) is that it is arguable that the judge had insufficiently analysed the ability of the appellant’s aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria given her failure to refer to the aunt's obligations and financial commitments. However, it was clear at the hearing before me, that there was simply no evidence before the judge of the financial obligations or commitments of the appellant's aunt. Furthermore, the aunt was not asked to explain precisely why she said it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant in Nigeria, which plainly called for an explanation in view of the amount of her savings, as I said at the hearing. Finally, point (iii) is that it is arguable that the judge had failed to give “a fuller analysis …. of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life”. This is an empty point as exemplified by the fact that Ms Ukachi-Lois did not pursue it at the hearing. For all of the reasons given above, it is clear that the three points raised by the permission judge were not only hopeless, they could not on any reasonable view have been adjudged as arguable Robinson obvious points, i.e. with a strong prospect of success. For all of the reasons given above, the judge did not make any error of law. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed. Turning to the grant of permission in AZ, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Holmes raised an issue concerning the delay (of about eight months) between the date of the hearing and the preparation of the decision. He referred to two cases on delay in his grant of permission: Mario [1998] Imm AR 281 and Sambasivam [1999] OATRF 1999/0419/4. However, the Upper Tribunal considered ([71]) that Judge Holmes had not correctly identified the relevant case law and that, in particular, he had failed to have regard to the more recent Tribunal authority of Arusha and Demushi (deprivation of citizenship – delay) [2012] UKUT 80 (IAC) which relied upon the Court of Appeal's judgment in RK (Algeria) [2007] EWCA Civ 868. The Tribunal said this at [70]-[71]: “70. The basic point to be borne in mind is that there must be an extremely sound reason for, in effect, compelling the parties to an appeal to engage with a matter that neither of them has identified. 71. The present case is an object lesson in what can happen when this principle of restraint is not respected….” In AZ, the Tribunal said (at [72]) that far from it being a case in which the ground raised by Judge Holmes of his own volition was strongly arguable, it was not a ground at all. This can certainly be said of point (i) raised by the permission judge in the instant case, because issues going to weight rarely give rise to an error of law, as has been said on many occasions (for example, Blake J, the then President, in Green (Article 8 – new rules) [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC)). It is difficult to see what error of law the permission judge had in mind in relation to point (iii) above which was not even pursued by Ms Ukachi-Lois at the hearing. However, the position is even worse in relation to point (ii). This is because the evidence which necessarily would have had to have been adduced to the judge in order to make good this point had not even been adduced. There was simply no evidence before the judge which could have enabled her to conduct any analysis of the financial commitments of the appellant's aunt. At para 70 of AZ, the Tribunal said that there must be an extremely sound reason for compelling the parties to engage with a matter that neither had identified. In the instant case, two of the three points were not even pursued at the hearing and one could not be established because the evidence necessary to establish the point was simply not before the judge. It is important to bear in mind that a grant of permission when it is not properly warranted wastes the limited resources of the Upper Tribunal, puts the parties to unnecessary expense, delays bringing finality to the case in question and contributes to delaying the disposition of other meritorious cases. It is therefore necessary to exercise self-restraint, as the Tribunal said in AZ. The following points of general guidance emerge from the instant case: (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ, the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. Decision There was no error of law in the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke. Accordingly, the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal against the respondent decision stands.  Signed Date: 6 June 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Gill",2019-06-07
3,RP/00159/2017," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: RP/00159/2017 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS At Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated:  on 07.01 & 11.04.2019 On 03.06.2019   Before: Upper Tribunal Judge John FREEMAN and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Toby DAVEY (on 11 April) Between: Gezim [M] appellant and Secretary of State for the Home Department respondent Representation: On 7 January: for the appellant: Joanne Rothwell (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Toby Lindsay On 11 April: for the appellant: Alison Harvey (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Tony Melvin DETERMINATION AND REASONS This is an appeal, by the respondent to the original appeal, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fiona Beach), sitting at Taylor House on 28 September 2018, to allow a revocation of protection appeal by a citizen of Kosovo, born 1972. HISTORY The appellant came as a visitor in 1991, overstayed and in 1992 claimed asylum, which was granted in 1997, followed by indefinite leave to remain in 1999. He has a long-standing partner, [VD], also from Kosovo, but now a British citizen, and they have twin daughters, V1 and V2, born here on 27 May 2006. In 2002 the appellant himself applied for British citizenship, but failed to reply to Home Office inquiries, so was refused the following year. Between May and August 2014, the appellant and another man took part in a conspiracy to steal with persons unknown who were ordering electronic items over the Internet, for delivery on rounds where they were able to get the Royal Mail and Parcelforce delivery drivers to sign for the goods as if they had been delivered. Over £40,000 worth of them were stolen, and, as the sentencing judge pointed out, a substantial breach of trust was involved. This was particularly the case with the appellant, who had begun as a courier driver himself, but by this time ran a business, employing a number of others. In the judge’s view, no real distinction could be made between the defendants’ position and that of Royal Mail drivers, in terms of the absolute integrity required by their work. After a three-week trial in June 2016 the appellant and his co-defendant were found guilty, and on 6 July the appellant was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment, with slightly less for the other man. The judge noted the favourable things said about the appellant, including by a prosecution witness: he was very well-liked and hard-working, and had built up his business from virtually nothing. However, he was doing well at it, and not in want of money, except to support his growing business. His had been a leading rôle in a conspiracy involving breach of a high degree of trust, and sophisticated planning. This sentence was followed on 22 July 2016 by a notice of intention to deport, to which the appellant replied on 28 August. Next, on 5 October, came notice of the Home Office’s intention to apply the presumption set out in s. 72 (2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, allowing for his expulsion despite the grant of asylum. On 16 August 2017 the UNHCR indicated that they had no objection to this course being taken, subject to a full examination of the appellant’s individual case, and on 28 October 2017 a deportation order was signed, and sent with full reasons on the 30th. APPEAL TO DATE The appellant did not pursue any protection claim, so there is no need to discuss his conviction or its consequences any further, except to say that, despite his good conduct while in prison, and since, there is clearly a strong public interest in his removal, as Judge Beach recognized. She referred to s. 117C of the 2002 Act, and in particular to Exception 2, set out at (4). The appellant clearly had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with a ‘qualifying partner’ and both ‘qualifying children’: the question was whether the effects of his deportation would be unduly harsh on them. It is now clear that, in both her case and theirs (see RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), referred to in more detail below), at paragraph 8: “As a result of KO (Nigeria), the position is that, in determining whether Exception 2 (in section 117C(5)) applies, a court or tribunal is not to have regard to the seriousness of the offence committed by the person who is liable to deportation.” The judge found as follows: “76. it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s partner to stay here without him; but it would not be unduly harsh for her to return to Kosovo with him; 84. it would be unduly harsh for the children to stay here without him; and 87. so would it be for them to go to Kosovo with him.” Those findings were challenged by the Home Office, in rather prolix grounds (not drafted by Mr Lindsay), and permission to appeal granted by a first-tier judge, on the basis that there had been a lack of explanation as to why it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s family to go to Kosovo with him: as just noted, this was not a finding the judge had made in respect of his partner. This did not seem to me to be what the case was really about: the children are both British citizens, who have always lived here, and already at secondary school. They are both of course entirely innocent parties, and, irrespective of what conditions might await them in Kosovo, it must now be unduly harsh to send them there. I made it clear to the parties at the first hearing on 7 January that the real question in my view had been whether the judge was entitled on the evidence to find that it would be unduly harsh either for the children or their mother to stay here without the appellant. Her decision had also been challenged on that point, as not supported by the evidence. I considered this required reconsideration, for reasons which will shortly become clear; but, in fairness to the appellant and the family as a whole, I also agreed to receive a psychological report on the mother, when re-making the decision. The further hearing for that was adjourned on 26 February, when it became clear that this report would not be ready for 4 March, as promised, till 11 April. I also made it clear that I should receive further oral evidence, limited to events since the first-tier hearing. ERROR OF LAW The appellant was sent to prison on 6 July 2016, and, with the usual 50% remission, served 13½ months before his release in late August 2017. From then till the final hearing before me, he has been at home with his family for just over 18 months. At paragraph 84, the judge concluded her reasons on the children’s position, if he were sent back to Kosovo, in this way, after accepting, on the basis of the partner’s own evidence and the report of an independent social worker, that she was ‘emotionally fragile’: “The appellant’s partner could seek support from professionals but an intervention by Social Services cannot be considered to be in the children’s best interests particularly at a time when they will be bewildered and upset by their father’s deportation from the UK.” No doubt children who had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with their father would inevitably be upset by his deportation; but it has to be said that one significant reason for these children to be especially bewildered by it must have been that their parents chose not to tell them anything about its being a possibility till just before the independent social worker made her report. Of course this mistaken, if to some extent understandable decision cannot be held against the children; but the independent social worker’s report has to be read in the light of the situation the parents had created. The grounds of appeal referred to BL (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 357. There were a number of significant factual differences, including BL having been sent to prison for four years; but I was concerned with extracting the relevant principles, rather than trying to match up the facts. The common features with this case, which led to the passage relied on by Mr Lindsay before me were these: the appellant’s partner and children were all British citizens; she was said to have difficulty in looking after them without him (in BL, because she drank more than was good for her), and the Upper Tribunal inferred that they would descend into poverty and require the support of the social services. What the Court of Appeal said about that, at paragraph 53, was this: “As against this, however, [the partner] had looked after the family while BL was in prison or immigration detention and the UT had not made any findings that the family had then descended into poverty or required the support of social services, or that if that were to happen, there would not be adequate support services for these children. The UT were entitled to work on the basis that the social services would perform their duties under the law and, contrary to the submission of [counsel for the appellant], the UT was not bound in these circumstances to regard the role of the social services as irrelevant.” While the judge reached a number of other findings on the evidence, in my judgment her conclusion on this point had to depend on her finding at paragraph 84, set out at 10 above, which showed a very different approach from that prescribed by the Court of Appeal in BL. For this reason, I took the view that her conclusion on the children’s position at 84 could not stand, and still less what she said about the effect on their mother of staying here without him at 76. This is why the judge’s decision, detailed and comprehensive as it was, had to be re-made. MORE LAW Following the fresh hearing on 11 April, our attention was drawn to RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), and we invited submissions on it by e-mail. Following the passage already cited at 6, the Tribunal went on to reject the appellant’s argument that MK (section 55 – Tribunal options) [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) prescribed any general approach to the facts, in cases such as this. At 17, once again summarizing the effect of KO, they said this: “… the test of “unduly harsh” has a dual aspect. It is not enough for the outcome to be “severe” or “bleak”. Proper effect must be given to the adverb “unduly”. The position is, therefore, significantly far removed from the test of “reasonableness”, as found in section 117B(6)(b).” That is as far as we need go with RA, since the rest of the decision on the law is concerned with the interpretation of s. 117C (6), which was not argued in this case, where the appellant must succeed under Exception 2, or not at all (until much later: see 54 – 55). It follows from the previous citation that, having noted the facts of the appellant’s offence, and the factors in his favour as part of the background, we are no longer concerned with them, though we should be if this were a s. 117C (6) case. The effect of his deportation on his partner and children has to be considered solely in terms of whether it would be unduly harsh on them. This is a question for our judgment, to be exercised in the light of the citation just made, and no further reference to the authorities is required. FRESH HEARING: EVIDENCE We heard evidence from both the appellant and his partner [VD]: from now on we shall refer to her by her personal name only. Both also made witness statements, as did the appellant’s mother [N] and his sister [I], who live together in this country. There is a report about the children by Sally-Anne Deacon CQSM, an ‘independent social worker’ (20 September 2018, with an addendum on 27 February), and one about [V] by Dr Tracy King, a clinical psychologist (2 April). There is also a report from [V]’s GP practice, containing one entry, for 16 July 2018. Apart from school reports on the children, those are the main sources of evidence before us. The appellant Most of his first statement is concerned with his own situation: we do not say that as a criticism, but to explain why we are not going into more detail on it. He describes how [V], the children and his mother and sister all came to see him in prison three times a month, the most allowed; he also spoke to [V] and the children ‘every single day without a miss’. The appellant and [V] hadn’t discussed his real situation with the children, as they felt they were too young, but simply told them he was going away to work in an institution and would be away for a long time. He accepted with hindsight that this might have been a mistake, and in his oral evidence he also made clear that the children would have seen posters and other signs on their visits, making it obvious to them what sort of a place he was in; but that had never been mentioned. As for [V], the appellant thought she would be ‘devastated’ if he were to be deported; he had heard she had been taken to hospital with a panic attack when he went to prison, and was given intravenous medication. She had found it very hard to cope without him, ‘especially since they did not understand why I was not there for them’. She had improved since his release, but was ‘rather fragile’, and he was worried how she would cope without him, or what he was earning. In oral evidence, the appellant explained that he had had to guide [V] with a number of things on visits and calls, such as how to tax their car. She had coped; but on the basis that this was only a temporary situation. She had hated being home alone, ever since she was young (we shall return to her early life in dealing with her evidence), and, if he wasn’t there at night, would wedge chairs under their flat door for security, which the children found rather funny. The appellant said he had done his best to help the children with homework and school projects, and both he and [V] had encouraged them to value themselves as girls. Neither of them had ever smacked them, as parents tended to in Kosovo. Without his earnings, [V] wouldn’t be able to afford extras, such as tai chi (though the appellant’s sister had paid for this while he was in prison) or after-school activities or trips, and wouldn’t have the confidence to drive far (if she could still afford to run their car at all). For the present, his previous employers, who had given him a reference for his court case, and were clearly aware of his record and status, had been happy to have him back, and even promoted him. As for the family’s situation if the appellant had to go back to Kosovo, job prospects there weren’t good: 65% were presently out of work. The appellant’s work experience here had been in ‘social care and transport logistics’, neither of which existed there. If he did get a job, he gathered the average wage was €350 a month. (We may as well say right now that, while we have no doubt that an enterprising hard-working man like him could fend for himself in a country he knew, if that were our concern, we do not regard it as at all likely that he would be able to send any significant amount of money back to help his family). While the appellant’s only close relations (his mother and sister) were here, [V] had a sister, who lived in Kosovo, though she was also a Canadian citizen. That had meant they could visit each other, and they had done so probably about ten times over the 15 years the appellant and [V] had been together. On four or five of those occasions, [V] had taken the children to Kosovo. Usually they spent five or six weeks away, as [V] got the same long summer holidays as them: the appellant would join them for two or three, as and when he could get away from work. Often they would go on trips (more cheaply arranged from Kosovo) to the coast in Albania, or even to Turkey. They had last all been to Kosovo in 2014, and since he had been unable to travel, [V]’s sister had been to see them here. [V] [V]’s first statement gives considerable detail about her family history. She was born in Kosovo in 1973, and when she was only nine months old, her father murdered her mother: she was lying on the bed next to her at the time, and was told what happened later by her maternal grandmother. Her father suffered from schizophrenia, and spent the rest of his life in hospitals, till he died in about 2009. All the children were first taken in by their paternal grandparents; but later the grandparents found that too much for them, and [V]’s siblings were sent to live with other relations. [V]’s brother went to Spain when he was 18, and she has been in touch with him only once or twice a year, in brief phone calls, since she last saw him in about 2012. One sister (Sofie) qualified in medicine before the war, and went to live with her husband in Canada, where they are citizens; but, as Sofie’s qualifications were not recognized there, they went back to Kosovo later: he runs a successful business, while she practises medicine. [V]’s other sister ([B]) came with her to this country in 1998, and married a Spaniard. Unfortunately, after [V] met the appellant in 2005, relations between her and [B] broke down, and they haven’t been in touch at all for the last three years, even though they live quite nearby. This has also affected [V]’s relationship with Sofie, though she does not explain to what extent. [V] says the appellant was always a hands-on father, and would feed, bathe and put their daughters to bed when they were small. Since then he has taken them for all kinds of activities, and shared fully in the house-work. She says his love has made her very secure and confident, and would be devastated if she lost his company, though she would never lose his love. The appellant’s arrest had come as a complete surprise to [V], while she was on holiday in Kosovo: he had been with her and the children, but had returned the week before they were due to come back. She found the investigation and trial process so intensely stressful that she couldn’t even write down the contact details for him when he was sentenced, and his solicitor had to do it for her. The following morning she was having panic attacks, with breathing problems: she got a friend to take the children to school, and went to a hospital A&E department, where tablets failed to calm her down, so she was given an intravenous injection, which enabled her to come home that night, with the help of the appellant’s sister [I] (Lili). Afterwards [V] managed to cope, by reminding herself that the appellant would only be in prison for just over a year. They went to see him regularly, and found him very emotional; the girls were not told he was in prison, but clearly suspected it. After they were told, in advance of their visit to Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’), they broke down, and were crying all through their interview with her. Since then they have been less anxious, as for the moment their father is with them. [V] speaks highly of the appellant’s attitude to others, polite to everyone, and generous, particularly to drivers who worked for him. She was shocked and surprised by what he had done, but regarded it as very much out of character. [V] says the appellant’s mother [N] is old (now 74) and has too many health problems of her own to help anyone else. His sister Lili works long hours, and has decided to remain single: she is very fond of the children, but hasn’t got very much time to help with them; nor does she drive. The appellant’s English is much better than [V]’s, so he has always been the one to help with homework, and go to parents’ evenings. [We found the appellant’s English extremely good, and [V]’s more than good enough to give evidence in; as should be the case for both of them, given the length of time they have been in this country]. [V] says she is happy to take the children to Kosovo for holidays, but not for them to grow up there, for reasons she gives, and which we have already accepted. She says she is finding it increasingly hard to cope as the hearing date (for his first-tier appeal) draws near, and is taking prescribed medication. The appellant was dishonest, but didn’t think about the consequences to his family, or anyone else, at the time; but seeing them suffer has been so distressing for him that he would never offend again. [V]’s second statement (6 February 2019) covers a good deal of the same ground again. She is finding it hard to sleep, or to listen to her daughters when they want to tell her about their day at school. She doesn’t feel she is doing her best at work, though no-one at her school has complained. She does have the children skills which might be expected from a teaching assistant; but coping with her own daughters’ needs, in her present mental state, is another matter. In her oral evidence, [V] said she hadn’t been taking medication again after her visit to the A&E till last summer, when the first-tier hearing was coming up. She knew the appellant had received a notice of intention to deport in July 2016; but she had been coping from month to month while he was in prison. As for visits to Kosovo, the appellant had last come with them before his arrest in 2014: he used to come for part of their visit every year. In 2018 [V] and the children had been there for four or five weeks and stayed with her sister Sofie: her sister-in-law Lili had paid their fares, and the appellant, though he couldn’t travel, had encouraged them to go, as had her GP. Lili and her mother lived not far away, in Gospel Oak, but, as previously mentioned, were unable to give much help. The children were still going to their tai chi, and had started piano lessons just before the last New Year. They all saw Lili and her mother on a Sunday; but she didn’t feel up to having the children’s friends to stay over. [V] provided evidence of recent appointments with Komal Oza, a ‘psychological wellbeing practitioner’, with iCope, an NHS service to which she had been referred by her GP in February. Mr Oza says they had met once, and have five further sessions planned: [V] was suffering from low mood and anxiety, and he hoped to be able to give her some help and support; but he thought it likely that, owing to the lack of certainty around her and her family’s future, she would continue to experience these symptoms. [N] (the appellant’s mother) [N] sets out the family history in Kosovo, and how they came to make their way to this country in 1994. She is still suffering from her husband’s death in 2010, after 44 years of marriage. Now she is nearly 75, with ‘very high blood pressure’, dizziness and shoulder and knee pain. [I] lives with her, and looks after her, subject to work pressure. She was so upset during the appellant’s trial that her family had to send her to Kosovo for the duration, where she suffered from continuous chest pain. She says how dependent she is on the appellant’s help; but we cannot consider whether the effect of his deportation on her would be unduly harsh, so this is more relevant to the question of what help she, or [I] could give [V] with the children and things in general, if he had to leave. Of course she speaks highly of him, and of the children, and expresses the fear that “… the whole family will descend into some darkness”, if he had to go. [I] (the appellant’s sister) [I] has been a British citizen since 2002: she gives more of the family history, and her own, including her work record, and the breakdown of her marriage in this country. She received her psychotherapy diploma in 2008, and has since done voluntary counselling work for six years for one day a week. She works for a beauty products company. [I] does not give her age, but was clearly a young grown-up when she first came here as an au pair in 1987 – 89. She had been very shocked when she found out about the appellant’s crimes; but she says he is still visibly sorry for them. Besides other visits, he always comes round to see her and their mother on a Sunday, which is their special family day, when they took care to book prison visits. On the question of what happened while the appellant was in prison, [I] says this (paragraph 23 of her statement) I managed to somehow support my brother’s family while [he] was in prison, but it was with the understanding that it was going to be only for the duration of his sentence. I also experienced my fair share of emotional turmoil trying to put on a brave face while at work and with my family. It was extremely difficult because I was constantly delaying my duties … sometimes calling in sick just so I can stay at home to recover my energy or even just simply by crying to myself on my own. [I] goes on to say that, much as she loves the children, she would never be able fully to support them, emotionally or financially, as she doesn’t earn enough, and sometimes has to travel for her work. She is afraid the responsibility in itself of taking her brother’s place would be too much for her. [I] explains the effect of what happened on her and her mother: As a result of [V]’s condition my mother and I rallied round and helped every day the best way we could. It was not easy, because all of us carried our own share of distress. We were in a constant state of just surviving every day the best way we could. They hadn’t known how to explain to the girls, then only ten, that their father faced deportation. Dr King (the clinical psychologist) Dr King’s very recent, long, discursive and somewhat repetitive report on [V] was of course not before the judge. She gives her assessment of her as suffering from the following personality disorders: Dependent Personality Disorder (over-reliance on others to meet emotional and physical needs, hard to make decisions without excessive advice from others, passivity, fear of being left alone to care for self, devastated by separation and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship). Avoidant Personality Style (extreme inhibition, inadequacy and sensitivity to negative criticism and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship), and Schizoid Personality Style (solitary habits, emotional distance difficulties expressing emotion) Dr King’s answers to the questions about [V] she was asked by the appellant’s solicitors were as follows (mostly summarized by us): Is she suffering from any known psychological conditions that have affected her mental health due to past experiences? See above, also Major Depression (recurrent, severe) and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Unusually dependent, self-effacing and non-competitive; lack of initiative and general avoidance of autonomy; vulnerable without support and sensitive to criticism; intensely needy of affection and nurturing; destabilized by finding out at the crucial age of 10 how she had come to lose both parents, with unconscious memories of the event itself ‘stored physiologically in the body’, reducing her mental resilience; exposed to the war in Kosovo, ‘females being particularly at risk’; high anxiety level apparently ‘suppressed to some degree with a functional level of depressive symptomatology to reduce the connection with the emotion of fear; any loss likely to trigger her unprocessed trauma and her early isolated life as a child; may withdraw from relationships if she fears rejection; lost older relations earlier than usual. Will try to appear calm, despite underlying fear; submits to the needs and fears of others to avoid rejection; “simple responsibilities may then demand more energy than she can muster; may feel life as empty, but draining, with weariness and apathy; may withdraw, depriving herself of support; fearful of humiliation and exclusion; shy, apprehensive and awkward; sees herself as “weak, fragile and inadequate and believes she is unable to meet everyday tasks without help”, minimal self-confidence, and puts herself down in the hope of reassurance. Disorientation and despondency indicate major depressive disorder; sensitive to ridicule and ‘worries that she worries’, giving the appearance of generalized personality disorder; daily apprehensive and short of sleep, tired, with aches and pains; restless, unable to concentrate, easily distracted and apt to fear the worst. If so, are these long-term and do they require sustained long-term treatment? Long-term treatment for at least two years required; at risk of frequent mental health instability till stabilized; even then at risk of relapses, owing to her age and the state to which her mental health has got. Medication likely to help, but anti-depressants will only manage some symptoms; needs personal therapy to build up her self-confidence and reduce her anxiety and low mood. Needs different approaches, such as Schema Focused Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing, less likely to be available on the NHS, and likely to cost about £100 a session for two years; current counselling will support her during that time, but will not deal with her underlying problems. Are these conditions likely to affect her day-to-day functioning and activities, such as ability to continue employment, study and running of the household and most importantly care of her daughters who are about to enter their teenage years and puberty? She will have difficulties in empathizing with and in setting in context her daughters’ concerns at their crucial age; at the moment her employer can cope with her having ‘bad days’; but this may not last, especially as she is working with special needs children, so she might lose her job; in view of her father’s reported schizophrenia, she might be at risk of genetic mental health trouble over time. She has a good relationship with the appellant’s mother and sister; but [N] needs support herself, and [I] can’t help with long-term support. This might mean her mental health got worse fast, and expose the children to neglect and isolation, for which she would be unlikely to seek help. In your opinion, how would the deportation of her husband exacerbate the psychological difficulties that she is experiencing today? Her dependent nature, there since her childhood experiences, is focused on the appellant, and would last for at least two years, at a crucial age for the children, when they would effectively lose both parents, one to deportation, and the other to mental health troubles. Deportation would be worse than when he went to prison, as it would be indefinite. She couldn’t see or speak to him so often, owing to the cost and safety concerns for women (and particularly the girls) in Kosovo. “Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident” [It is not clear how Dr King is able to give a professional opinion about this, on the basis of her very recent knowledge of [V]]. Explain or comment on her current difficulties that she is experiencing since her partner’s appeal was won, and then when the Home Office appealed, and the whole situation regarding the deportation has returned to square one. The situation for [V] is very difficult, as she was confident it had been put right, but then returned to the original very frightening situation. “This feeds into her sense of instability and lack of control and reinforces her sense of helplessness. These will create physiological responses in the body that are likely to directly trigger her early infant trauma of being present at her mother’s murder and her teenage trauma of being exposed to war in Kosovo. The deterioration evident is explained in prior questions with regard to her overall psychological formulation” Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’ naturally covers a great deal within Dr King’s expertise, and also covered by her; so we shall try to summarize her reports only so far as they add anything significant. They do not contain any summary of her conclusions, and reference to them is not helped by the lack of numbered paragraphs. We have already dismissed the possibility of the girls’ having to move to Kosovo, so that part of Ms Deacon’s evidence need not be considered. Clearly if they are to stay here without the appellant, then they must have their mother to look after them; so the question for us is whether it would be unduly harsh for them or her to have to stay here without him. While it is clear from Ms Deacon’s report that the appellant is a very good father, very close to the girls, and a provider, it is equally clear that [V] has “highly skilled levels of parenting”, as Ms Deacon puts it. Both girls are doing very well at school (as their reports show; and both were described as ‘exceptionally gifted’ to Ms Deacon by the head of their year) and equally well in their personal lives, as Ms Deacon’s report makes clear at p 17. So far as the direct effect on the girls of being without their father is concerned, Ms Deacon says this in her first report, at p 16 It is also argued that the girls could maintain contact with their father through regular visits to Kosovo and modern means of communication. However I feel that these methods are significantly inadequate and impracticable given [their] familiarity with their father’s physical presence, the positive nature of their attachment and the family’s anticipated lack of financial resources Ms Deacon had already given the basis for this conclusion, so far as the girls’ attachment to the appellant was concerned, and on that basis it can easily be accepted that keeping in touch at a distance, and on visits, would be very much less satisfactory for both them and him. At p 7, Ms Deacon quotes [I], who (she says) is a qualified child and adolescent psychotherapist, as saying that the appellant’s time in prison was … devastating for the children, but manageable with everyone’s support because it was short term and the girls were able to see their dad regularly. If this happens again it will be forever and the levels of abandonment that the girls would feel would have a significant effect on the future for them in terms of their identity, their mental health and their ability to fulfil their potential. We do not of course take this by way of professional expertise on the part of [I], talking about close members of her own family. Given the effect of KO, as set out in RA (see our 15), we take the view that the main question for us is not whether [V] could keep up the present standards of care for the girls on her own, without the appellant’s emotional, practical and financial support; but whether her ability to do so, without him, would collapse to the point of its being unduly harsh to her, or, even more importantly, them, for him to be removed. The answer mainly depends on Dr King’s evidence; but we shall look at Ms Deacon’s to see what help she can give on it. Ms Deacon gives her opinion (at p 16), disclaiming any specific professional expertise in this area, that the appellant’s deportation would appear likely to result in “a protracted, if not permanent decline in [V]’s mental health, which is likely to compromise her current highly skilled levels of parenting”. The evidence Ms Deacon relates in her first report, which is capable of supporting that conclusion, is already available to us from other witnesses: for example, at p 9, the appellant’s about her jamming their flat door with chairs if he is not there, and [I]’s about her lacking resilience and having ‘fallen apart’ while the appellant was in prison, and needing to be hospitalized. As we know from her own evidence (see 28), this did not last long. In Ms Deacon’s second report, she deals with the case under three headings, which do not entirely reflect the contents of what follows. Her first point (1) consists in a return to what happened when the appellant went to prison; then she goes on to consider the effect on the girls themselves of having to do without their father. In considering the ‘extreme and understandable distress’ they had shown, we shall need to consider, as she does not, the effect of the way the news of its possibility had been broken to them: see 29. That is the context for our consideration of what she goes on to say about them experiencing their father’s permanent absence “as tantamount to a parental death”. At 2, Ms Deacon again draws the distinction between the effect on [V] of the appellant’s permanent absence, as compared to his temporary absence in prison, and returns to the quality of contact that could be kept up between him, her and the children, for example by Skype, from Kosovo. She expresses the view that [V]’s ‘anticipated heightened levels of anxiety’ would force her to terminate her employment, in which case regular visits there would be beyond her means. At 3, Ms Deacon makes the point that teenagers do better with the support of their parents, and may take to drink, drugs or other vices if allowed to go astray. She notes these girls’ high performance at school, and ambitions for their future lives, and repeats the view that the appellant’s absence in itself would have “… potential to have catastrophic implications for the girls’ futures”, especially if [V] became ‘unwell’ without him. At 4, Ms Deacon notes the availability of social care; but she takes the view that this would be unlikely to be offered on a long-term basis as a protection need for the children, as they have an extended family who could take responsibility. This is slightly at odds with [V]’s own evidence about [I]’s commitments and [N]’s lack of capacity. Ms Deacon goes on to note the availability of voluntary support; but she concludes that this would be unlikely to be offered more than once a week, which would not be adequate. She has not informed herself on [V]’s take-up of mental health support; but again she speaks of “a significant delay in assessing this resource”, owing to nationwide demands. GP report This relates to what is described as a first depressive episode, which [V] came in with on 16 July 2018. By this time the appellant would have been out of prison for nearly a year, and was awaiting his first-tier appeal hearing on 28 September. Her history is given as ‘’depression with low mood, lack concentration, difficulty focusing, poor sleep’’: the context is given, and the only further potentially significant point is ‘’prev[ious] depression around time girls born, again, never self harm thoughts then either. Case due to be heard in September’’. [V] was prescribed the well-known anti-depressant Citalopram, and was to be reviewed in two or three weeks. It was noted “can self ref[er] psychology at any stage”: no doubt this was advice which had been given her at the time. There is then a final entry ‘crisis plans’: presumably this also referred to advice, but no further details are given. There is no evidence from the GP about any further appointments, or prescriptions; and no evidence of any reference by [V] or anyone else to a psychologist, until this was finally done in response to the application made by the appellant’s then counsel, on the basis of which I adjourned the hearing to 4 March, and then 11 April. (I was a little put out to see that Dr King dates her instructions only from 9 March; but Miss Harvey succeeded in reassuring me that something at least had been done before that). That concludes our treatment of the main sources of evidence, as listed at 17, so we shall now turn to the argument. DISCUSSION Both advocates made oral submissions at the hearing, and others in writing, in Miss Harvey’s case by e-mail, in response to the late submission of RA by Mr Melvin. Since these dealt with her general argument, it is convenient to take that first. Besides the ‘unduly harsh’ point, extensively discussed at the hearing, Miss Harvey relies on the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception under s. 117C (6), on the basis that the appellant … has lived lawfully in the UK for some 28 years, since 1 September 1992 and was recognised as a refugee from the war in Kosovo. The very long length of his residence and that, as a refugee, for many years the UK was the only country that he could call home are factors, taken cumulatively with those that bring the case within Exception 2, constitute very compelling circumstances. That is not an argument we can accept: if we had regarded it as arguable, then we should either have had to re-open the case for a third hearing, or else invite Mr Melvin to reply by e-mail. However, while the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception is open in a medium-sentence case, as made clear in NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662, this case was argued throughout before us, with good reason, on the basis that this appellant must succeed, if at all, under Exception 2. The version of the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument put forward in Miss Harvey’s e-mail here is ‘over and above’ Exception 1, if anything. Exception 1 was not argued before us, or at the first-tier hearing, for the good reason that this appellant, born on 28 December 1972, was already 28 years 8 months old when he arrived in this country, on 31 August 1991, and, following that, had spent only another 26 years and (nearly) 2 months here by the date of the decision under appeal on 30 October 2017, so had not been here for ‘most of his life’. The ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which will only become relevant if the appellant fails on the ‘unduly harsh’ point: see NA (Pakistan) at paragraph 36. Besides that, it is quite clear from the appellant’s own evidence that he has quite happily taken his family on holiday to Kosovo and nearby countries a number of times over more recent years, and is by no means a person whose only possible home is here now. Dealing with the present situation as we must, the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which could not in any case succeed on its merits. The other additional point of law taken in Miss Harvey’s e-mail is her reliance, in rather general terms, on the continuing validity of Strasburg jurisprudence on article 8. While no doubt she is right in principle on that, we were not in any case proposing to take any notice of the Home Office circular relied on by Mr Melvin, but to base our decision squarely on the ‘unduly harsh’ point, as laid down by Parliament, definitively defined in KO, explained in RA and argued before us. As already explained at 16, there is no need to go further into the authorities in this case: there is one question, for us to answer in what is described in MK as an exercise of ‘evaluative judgment’. Would the consequences of the appellant’s removal be unduly harsh, either for his children (directly or because of the effect on their mother), on on [V]? Dealing first with the direct consequences, we entirely accept that both the girls and [V] are particularly close to the appellant; in [V]’s case, perhaps all the more because of the continuing effects of her grisly early history (see 25); remote contact with him (by Skype or the like) could not replace face-to-face, especially for girls of that age; and they would all have a considerably lower standard of living without his income; the only direct relevance of this to the ‘unduly harsh’ criterion is that it would make it harder for them to go and see him in Kosovo. We do not accept that such visits would be completely impossible: [I] could no doubt give some help in finding the money for occasional tickets for the cheap flights which are on offer to Kosovo, as with many eastern European destinations, even if she is unable to take on any regular or continuing responsibility. Once there, [V]’s sister Sofie certainly could, and there is reason to suppose, given her past hospitality, would help with arrangements. The result is that, though the direct effects of the appellant’s removal on the girls remain something to be borne in mind on the ‘unduly harsh’ question as a whole, they cannot answer it in his favour on their own. The same would apply to the direct effects on [V], if they went no further than missing his practical, financial or emotional support. Sadly, as made clear in KO and a number of previous decisions, missing a father or a partner, even very much indeed, may be harsh, but is a normal, rather than an unduly harsh consequence of his deportation. In our view the key to this case is whether the consequences of the appellant’s deportation would go so far as to include what in ordinary language we should call a complete breakdown on [V]’s part. If they did, we should be prepared to accept that they would indeed be unduly harsh for her, and, because of their effect on her, for the girls; but not otherwise. Simply not being able to look after them as well as she does now would not be enough to make it unduly harsh for them. While that state of affairs would no doubt be extremely worrying for [V], we do not think that could be described as unduly harsh for her, unless, once again, it led to a complete breakdown. CONCLUSIONS As we have already made clear, the crucial evidence on this point is Dr King’s: from her 4.1, she had exactly the same sources of information as we do, with a three-hour interview with [V] taking the place of the oral evidence we heard from her. While we do not doubt the general validity of Dr King’s conclusions at 1 and 2 (see our 41), the most relevant questions for our purposes are 3 and 4. Bearing in mind that Dr King’s first-hand knowledge of [V] is so very recent (from their interview less than a month before the hearing), some detailed consideration of her recent history was clearly important. Dr King lists the GP report among her sources, and we should have expected some discussion at 3 of whether or not there had been any further visits to the surgery, or attempts to seek their help, or that of the NHS psychology service; and, if not, why not. We do not doubt that [V] was genuinely anxious about the appellant’s future when she saw the GP last July. It was clearly significant that she did so, and on the evidence before us only did so, when the first-tier hearing was approaching. The question is whether [V] went to see her GP because the uncertainty involved in that prospect had made her notably more anxious than she had been before; or because she wanted, or had been told, to get further evidence for the hearing? Similarly there was no attempt to get any further psychological help for [V] till after the Home Office appeal first came before me on 7 January, and Dr King’s involvement was forensic, rather than therapeutic. Only in February (see 35) did [V] get referred by her GP to Mr Oza, and any help he had been able to give her was at a very early stage, though he was not optimistic about the results. We have no evidence as to how the referral to Mr Oza came about, though the involvement of Dr King was clearly on legal advice, following the adjournment in January. We do bear in mind what both Dr King and Ms Deacon say about [V]’s reluctance to seek help, and we certainly do not regard the fact that she only did so on the occasions just mentioned as fatal to the contention that she would break down without the appellant, failing the two years or more of weekly treatment recommended by Dr King under 2. We regard her as an entirely genuine witness, and we have no doubt that her visit to her GP when the first-tier hearing was approaching was brought about by genuinely increased anxiety on her part. What the lack of any other previous attempts to seek help does mean, however, is that [V]’s likely response to being without the appellant has to be tested, so far as practical, rather than theoretical facts are concerned, to a very large extent on what happened while he was in prison between 1 July 2016 and late August 2017. Under 4, Dr King says this about [V] being without the appellant then Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident. However she could see him weekly and have daily telephone contact with him for support. There was also an end in sight for them to reunite. She therefore will not have felt so helpless or out of control as she does now. The last three sentences of that passage make perfectly good sense, and indeed correspond with findings we should have been prepared to make for ourselves on the evidence before us, including [V]’s live evidence, and rather anxious appearance as she gave it. However the language of the first (‘presentation’) tends to suggest a professional observation by the user, which of course was something Dr King had had no opportunity of while the appellant was in prison. There is a similar lack of investigation of [V]’s recent history (see 52) on the part of Ms Deacon, so far as she is qualified to give an opinion on the point we are considering; and she refers to her ‘hospitalisation’ at 48 without making it clear that it had only been temporary. Of course we bear in mind that the intravenous medication [V] was given when she took herself in to the A&E department had been a rather drastic intervention, and, in view of her failure to respond to the tablets she was given, no doubt a necessary one. However, [V] had been able to cope after that, though again we bear in mind that she was able to speak to the appellant every day, and see him every week. In the process she had to be talked through such ordinary details of organizing one’s own life as how to set about taxing the family car, to which she has now been introduced. Although the appellant refers to the anxiety (irrational in this country) which [V] had shown by jamming the front door with chairs every night when he was away, this now dates back nearly two years. More recently, she had felt able to leave the appellant at home here last summer and take the children to Kosovo for four or five weeks, though with the help of [I], who had paid for their trip, and they stayed with [V]’s sister Sofie. It is quite true that the girls, both 13, are now at a crucial stage in their lives, and that remains a relevant factor, though it does not in itself require their father’s appeal to be allowed (as made clear by the Tribunal in RA, in their treatment of MK). The other self-evident truth about them is that they will be growing up fast: as time goes on, they will need less support from their mother, and be able to give her more themselves. On that basis, the crucial period for the girls will last for a relatively short time after the appellant has to leave, if eventually that does happen. While [N] is unlikely, in view of her health, to be able to give any practical support, a grandmother’s wisdom and experience can itself be valuable. Though [I] disclaims any ability to commit herself to long-term support, she has, to her credit, shown herself ready and willing to make a valuable contribution by paying for [V]’s trip to Kosovo with the girls last summer. Neither Dr King nor Ms Deacon deals with this point: 13-year olds, and particularly girls are growing up fast, and the need for support for them and their mother cannot be assessed as if the situation were static. We bear in mind what Dr King says under 2 (see our 41) about [V]’s need for long-term help, and the limited value of what can be done in the short term; and also Ms Deacon’s views at 52 about the limited scope of help available from public sources. However, on the basis that the crucial period for the girls is likely to last for a limited time, [V] and the girls can all get useful help from [I], and [V] should be able to cope with such short-term help as she can get from her GP, social services, or the NHS psychology service (as she did without any of that, though with much greater opportunity for contact with the appellant, while he was in prison). That does not entirely deal with [V]’s own position, as she would no doubt still miss the appellant very badly, even after the girls had adapted to his departure. However, once she had got through the crucial period for them, we think she should be able to stay here with them for as long as they need her to look after them: while that may be for more than five years, it is likely to be less than the ten for which the appellant himself would be excluded, following deportation. We think the judge was right not to regard joining the appellant in Kosovo as unduly harsh for [V], for her own sake rather than the girls’. Once they no longer needed her living with them and looking after them, [V] would have the choice whether to wait till the appellant could eventually rejoin her here (which we see no reason why he should not, once ten years have passed); or to rejoin him in Kosovo. That would give [V] at least something other than permanent separation from the appellant to look forward to, and so we cannot regard the consequences of his removal as unduly harsh for her, for her own sake, either. On that basis, though the consequences of the appellant’s having to go will certainly be harsh for the whole family, we cannot, on the law as declared in KO, regard them as unduly harsh, either for [V] or for the girls. That is the starting-point for our consideration of article 8, and we have not been referred to any specific Strasburg or other jurisprudence or legislation which might make it inapplicable, or modify it in this case. The result is that the Home Office appeal must be allowed. We reach this conclusion with complete lack of enthusiasm: [V] and the girls are all British citizens, leading hard-working lives and, in the girls’ cases, potentially valuable ones to society outside their own family. They are all innocent parties, and the consequences for all of them will be harsh. RA makes it clear that the appellant is not entitled to rely on the result of the individual case in MK, as opposed to the principles set out in it, endorsed in KO; but we do note that the children in MK were only seven, so would go on requiring support for very much longer than in this case. Even the appellant, not that his interests are for us to consider, has always been a hard-working man, and, apart from becoming involved in crime, an excellent father and partner. He was an engaging witness, and we have no doubt he genuinely regrets his past dishonesty, if only for the harsh effects it has had, and may now go on having for his family. If we had had to consider only the proportionality of his removal to the public interest in the prevention of crime, without looking at it through the ‘unduly harsh’ test, then we might have reached a different result; but that is not the case.

Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant(s).1. This is a decision to which both judges have contributed.2. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart promulgated 22.11.18, dismissing on asylum and humanitarian protection grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of 6.2.17 to terminate his refugee status and to deport him from the UK, but allowing the appeal on articles 3 & 8 ECHR grounds. For ease of reference I will refer to the Secretary of State (who was the original respondent) as ""the Secretary of State"" and to FA (who the original respondent) as the ""claimant.""3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson granted permission to appeal to the Secretary of State on 12.12.18. 4. The claimant cross appealed against the dismissal of the appeal on refugee grounds but permission was refused in the First-tier Tribunal by Designated First-Tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft on 7.1.19 and in the Upper Tribunal by Upper Tribunal Judge Smith on 8.3.19.5. It follows that the only valid appeal before the Upper Tribunal is that of the Secretary of State against the decision allowing the appeal on articles 3 and 8 grounds. However, the claimant has served a Rule 24 reply, which we have carefully considered.6. Whilst the claimant was legally represented at the appeal hearing, he chose not to attend.7. At the conclusion of the oral submissions before us, both parties sought and were granted permission to lodge and serve within 14 days further legal case authorities touching on the issue as to whether it is open to a tribunal to find that a potential deportee would be at risk on return of treatment infringing article 3 rights because of a claimed reasonable likelihood that he would go on to commit criminal offences, thereby resulting in his punishment and incarceration in a country of return where the treatment of detained persons has been held to be inhuman and infringing article 3 ECHR. The claimant also sought and was granted permission to cite further legal case authority relevant to the issue of delay raised by the Home Office in argument at the hearing but not foreshadowed in its submitted grounds. 8. The claimant's further submissions, dated 13.5.19, were received by the tribunal on 14.5.19. The appellant's further submissions, dated 14.5.19, were received by the tribunal on 14.5.19. The claimant then made yet further submissions, dated 15.5.19, we have carefully considered the respective submissions. Error of Law9. In an otherwise careful and detailed consideration of the relevant issues by the First-tier Tribunal, for the reasons set out below we have found such error of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require it to be set aside and remade by remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal on the articles 3 and 8 ECHR issue only. 10. We remind ourselves that the issue is not whether we or another judge would have made the same decision as the First-tier Tribunal but whether the decision made in relation to Articles 3 and 8 is sustainable. 11. Having heard detailed submissions from both Mr Lindsay for the Secretary of State as appellant and Mr Sellwood for the claimant we find as follows. Late Issue12. Mr Lindsay relied on the details grounds of application for permission to appeal, which he accepted may not have been as clear as they could have been. He also sought to rely and to make submissions on an additional issue not addressed in the grounds but which appears to have been relied on by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at [144] of the decision, namely the apparent delay between the index offence committed in 2009 and the deportation decision of 6.2.18. At [36] the judge recorded the submission on behalf of the Secretary of State that there was no evidence to suggest that either the public interest had lessened or that the claimant's private and family life had strengthened during the intervening period. Mr Lindsay argued that that submission had not been addressed by the judge and thus there was an error of law in the reliance on delay made at [144] of the decision.13. Mr Sellwood objected to the late introduction of the delay issue when it had not featured in the details grounds of application for permission to appeal. Whilst he accepted that he would be able to address the issue in his oral submissions, he made the fair point that he had not been able to prepare a detailed response, or to research any relevant authorities on the point. After hearing both parties on the matter, we considered that in a detailed consideration as to whether a person was to be deported to the DRC, with potentially serious implications, we should enable all relevant issues to be addressed rather than enforce a strict procedural adherence to the pleaded grounds but would ensure that the claimant was not unfairly prejudiced by the late introduction of the issue. For that reason, as indicated above, at the end of the hearing we granted Mr Sellwood the opportunity to identify to the tribunal panel any relevant authorities before the making of the decision on the appeal.Delay14. Mr Lindsay raised the new ground of the judge's reliance at [144] on delay as a material consideration in reducing the weight to be given to the public interest in deportation and in allowing the appeal. The judge noted that 9 years had elapsed since the commission of the index offence justifying deportation and that consideration of revocation of refugee status began in 2012. The judge continued, ""At that point no action was taken against him. It must be inferred that having conducted a review at the time the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest necessitated the appellant's deportation."" 15. We accept the submission that the judge was in error of law to draw such an inference, particularly given the wide ranging changes to the relevant provisions governing deportation considerations that have taken place since 2012. To reduce the weight of the public interest in this way because of the delay and the drawing of such an inference is an error of law, particularly as the public interest has not diminished over time and it cannot properly be inferred that at the time the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest to necessitate the claimant's deportation.16. In granting leave to make further submissions on the issue, we accepted that Mr Sellwood had not prepared the claimant's case to address this new issue. However, we find nothing in the further submissions strengthens his argument or undermines the complaint of the Secretary of State that reliance on delay was not justified. Reliance is made on RLP (Bah revisited - expeditious justice) Jamaica [2017] UKUT 00330 (IAC), where it was held that in cases where the public interest favouring deportation is potent and pressing, even egregious and unjustified delay on the part of the Secretary of State in making the underlying decision is unlikely to tip the balance in the individual's favour in the article 8 proportionality balancing exercise. However, we accept that delay is a potentially relevant factor in the proportionality exercise. In EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41, the House of Lords held that delay may reduce the weight otherwise to be accorded to firm and fair immigration control if the delay is a result of a dysfunctional system which creates unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes. We also accept that, obviously, during a period of delay an applicant may develop closer personal and social ties, thereby strengthening a family and private life claim to remain in the UK. In MN-T (Colombia) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 893, the Court of Appeal held that delay may lessen the weight of public interest considerations of deterrence and societal revulsion. Further, during lengthy delay a foreign criminal may be able to demonstrate he has rehabilitated. These are all relevant considerations but the difficulty for Mr Sellwood's argument is that these were not adequately addressed in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, where the judge proceeds on the assumption that it must be inferred from the delay that the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest necessitated deportation. That assessment was flawed and unsustainable. It follows that on this additional ground of reliance on delay, we also find the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in error of law. Article 317. Following a lengthy and careful digest of the evidence and the findings and conclusions which are not at issue in this appeal, the article 3 considerations are set out relatively briefly between [126] and [128] of the decision. In essence, the tribunal found that whilst there would be no Article 15(c) risk on return and no reason to depart from the Country Guidance of BM and others (returnees - criminal and noncriminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC), which is to the effect that those who have been convicted of offences in the UK are not at real risk of being persecuted or suffering serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR on return to the DRC, the judge concluded that there was a risk of destitution infringing Article 3 for the following specified reasons set out at [128] of the decision:(a) In light of the appellant's age when he left the DRC;(b) The likelihood of there being no family support available to him on return;(c) His lack of fluency in the main languages; and(d) Obstacles in securing accommodation and employment, although his partner confirmed that she would be willing to financially assist him in the short but not the longer term.18. In his oral submissions, Mr Lindsay relied primarily on two decisions from the Court of Appeal, copies of which were provided to the panel:(a) Binbuga [2019] EWCA Civ 551;(b) Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442.19. Mr Lindsay's attack on the destitution reasons can be summarised briefly as follows:(a) The age when the claimant left the DRC is not determinative of the issue of destitution;(b) The absence of family support was contradicted by the finding that the claimant's partner would assist him in the short term;(c) As is clear from [76] the claimant spoke Lingala with his mother, save for certain words he cannot understand. He would therefore be able to communicate in the DRC and would have little difficulty gaining fluency;(d) Difficulties in securing accommodation and/or employment did not amount to evidence of destitution.20. Whilst we are satisfied that the judge did not make any mistake of fact or reach inconsistent findings in respect of these issues, we have carefully considered whether any of these (or other) factors individually or taken together could justify a conclusion of a real risk of destitution sufficient to infringe Article 3 ECHR bearing in mind the high threshold required. In Said, the Court of Appeal held that to succeed in resisting removal on Article 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or deprivation on return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country or others, the person liable to deportation must show circumstances which bring him within the approach of the Strasbourg Court in the D and N cases. 21. Mr Sellwood sought to draw a distinction relying on [29] to [30] of Said, and submitted that the risk of destitution arises because of the state's indifference to circumstances which would amount to an infringement of Article 3, effectively an acquiescence in harm, and thus submitted that the N threshold did not apply. However, we did not find any such distinction was made by the First-tier Tribunal or applies on the facts of this case. It is clear that the judge's reasoning for finding a risk of destitution did not rely on indiscriminate violence in IDP camps or because of the conditions of the country, or similar such considerations, but specifically because of the claimant's personal circumstances on return. 22. We find that the judge did not consider the very high threshold applicable and did not have regard to Said. Further, it is clear to us that even taking the evidence at its highest, the circumstances on return cannot justify such a conclusion even in the challenging environment that would face anyone returning to the DRC. In particular, as has already been noted, the appellant has a good understanding of the language and the judge found that he will have some temporary financial assistance from his partner on return. In the circumstances we are driven to conclude this part of the decision is flawed for inadequate reasoning, insufficient to justify the conclusion of an infringement of Article 3 on the basis of a risk of destitution and, therefore, in error of law. 23. Mr Sellwood and the Rule 24 response points out that the prospect of destitution was not the only basis upon which the judge concluded Article 3 would be infringed. We agree. As part and parcel of the Article 3 conclusion, at [128] the judge also found a ""risk of (the claimant) returning to drug use and reasonable risk of further incarceration in DRC."" We also find this conclusion problematic even though it is based on the unchallenged expert evidence, in part of Dr Kofi but to a greater extent of Dr Lackenby, summarised at [127] of the decision. Dr Lackenby considered that the appellant would be vulnerable to return to drug use, antisocial behaviour and/or criminal activity if deported to the DRC. The judge found or accepted, ""This gives rise to a very real prospect of further detention in abject conditions."" 24. We accept that the claimant has an appalling criminal history, having amassed some 19 separate convictions for 34 criminal offences between 2004 and 2014. In January 2009 he was convicted of possession with intent to supply Class A (cocaine) and Class B (cannabis) controlled drugs, for which he was sentenced to a total term of four years in a Young Offender Institute. During and even after his release from that sentence, he continued to offend, albeit to a lesser degree. He was also a member of a known criminal gang, though the First-tier Tribunal accepted that he was not particularly high in the hierarchy. He had also been given an Osman warning in 2017. The deportation order was made on the basis of the four year sentence, on the basis that his deportation was conducive to the public good. 25. In essence, the argument is that because the claimant has previously been convicted of drugs offences, despite all the suggestions in the evidence adduced on his behalf that he is now a reformed character and would remain drug-free, he should not be removed from the UK because he would go on to commit criminal offences in the DRC, leading to his prosecution and imprisonment in what are accepted would be conditions infringing Article 3. 26. The argument is further advanced in Mr Sellwood's post-hearing written submissions. It is not necessary to rehearse the well-established legal principles elaborated upon by Mr Sellwood, which are not in contention, but we readily accept that if there is a real risk of a person being subjected to degrading or inhuman treatment in a particular country so as to amount to an infringement of article 3, that would constitute an absolute prohibition on expulsion, even if the risk arises from the subject's conduct or activity, and even if such activity is conducted in bad faith. In SSHD v Iftikhar Ahmed [1999] EWCA Civ 3003, the Court of Appeal concluded that if an asylum seeker would in fact do things after return which would put them at real risk of persecution for a Convention reason, there is an entitlement to protection, however unreasonable the conduct. In HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31, the Supreme Court held that attention must be focused on what the claimant would actually do if returned to his country of nationality. The fact that he could take action to avoid persecution does not disentitled him from asylum if in fact he will not act in such a way as to avoid it, even if to fail to do so would be unreasonable. 27. We accept that article 3 is a non-derogable right prohibiting in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person seeking to rely on such protection. However, we find Mr Sellwood's submissions and the supporting legal authorities he cites fall short of supporting the basis upon which Judge Bart-Stewart allowed the appeal under article 3, namely that the claimant would be vulnerable to further drug use and criminal behaviour so as to give rise to the prospect of detention in conditions infringing article 3. We accept as well-made the Secretary of State's argument that the protection of article 3 cannot properly be construed so as to protect those who freely choose criminal conduct that if pursued would give rise to a real risk of treatment infringing article 3. We accept that a distinction must sensibly be drawn between on the one hand those who cannot help but, or who are alternatively entitled to, conduct themselves in a way that gives rise to a risk of treatment infringing article 3, and on the other those who choose to commit crime or engage in other anti-social and illegal activity through personal choice and/or for financial gain. Whilst even the most serious public policy considerations cannot override the absolute prohibition on treatment infringing article 3, there is an important and significant public policy consideration that to construe the protection of article 3 in the way the First-tier Tribunal Judge did and for which Mr Sellwood contends would incentivise criminal conduct in the UK by claimants seeking to avoid deportation. 28. We readily understand and accept that the claimant would not have the same stable support structure available to him as he has in the UK and on any view the risk of recidivism must be greater in the DRC than in the UK. We also acknowledge that to an extent both parties are trying to have their cake and eat it. For example, the Secretary of State relies on the risk the claimant presents for the protection of the public by reason of his drug dealing convictions as being sufficient to deport him but at the same time, in reliance on the suggestion that he would not face a risk of return to offending on return, points out that there was no evidence that he is a drug addict or took anything other than cannabis whilst dealing in the harder drug of cocaine. We note the claimant's own evidence, summarised at [119-120] of the decision, is that he had relocated away from his gang or peer associations and had not reoffended since 2014. 29. We find the core argument untenable, unsupported as it is by any legal authority or precedent. This is not an argument of double jeopardy where the claimant would face further punishment in the DRC for the crimes he committed and for which he was sentenced in the UK. Neither is this a situation akin to HJ (Iran) principles where a returnee is entitled to pursue his political opinion, faith or sexual orientation; we cannot accept that the claimant has the right to protection because he is inherently criminal or might in the future behave like a criminal. It is one thing to accept that if imprisoned because of his past behaviour he would face a real risk of incarceration in conditions infringing Article 3, but it is entirely another to suggest that because he is of criminal inclination or outlook the tribunal must proceed on the expectation that he would commit further criminal offences in the DRC and in due course find himself detained in inhuman conditions. If this argument were to be adopted in principle, it would prove almost impossible to return to a wide range of countries around the world any person being deported on the basis of having committed serious criminal offences in the UK. We find no authority for the proposition that one must look to see whether a returnee is likely to or might commit further offences so as face the risk of incarceration in unacceptable conditions infringing Article 3. In any event, we find such a risk is speculative and far too remote.30. It will be the claimant's free choice whether to continue to commit criminal offences on return. In the circumstances, we do not accept that any propensity to reoffend can be equated to an imputed or innate characteristic, such as mental ill-health, or a genuinely held belief, such as political opinion or religious faith. Committing crime is not central to the claimant's identity such as to entitle him to international protection from the consequences of a deliberate choice to offend. In our view, he cannot sensibly be entitled to international protection against the consequences of any future criminal conduct. As stated in SE (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 256, an offender cannot rely upon his own partially unreformed criminality as a factor relevant (in that case) to either his family or private life. Article 3 was not argued in that case. 31. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, we find each aspect of the First-tier Tribunal Article 3 considerations flawed and as the judge combined them at [128] to reach the conclusion that the high threshold had been reached, the decision on Article 3 was made in material error of law. Article 8 Consideration - Very Compelling Circumstances32. We also heard Mr Lindsay's detailed arguments as to the Article 8 very compelling circumstances considerations set out in the decision from [129] onwards. We accept that on the facts of this case there is a considerable degree of overlap between Articles 3 and 8. At [134] the judge relied on: the claimant's young age when he left the DRC and formative upbringing in the UK; a finding that there would be very significant obstacles to his integration in the DRC (based on Dr Kodi's opinion); that he has no family in the DRC; that he ""does not speak the language;"" and has no accommodation or means of support. The judge went on to note that the claimant poses a moderate to low risk of reoffending, which will remain the case if he continues on the path of rehabilitation and lifestyle change. 33. Mr Lindsay highlighted concern at [134] where the judge stated ""The offending history in itself does not prevent him being socially and culturally integrated in the UK,"" which does not seem to acknowledge that the claimant's long criminal record, including offences before and after the index offence as well as offences of violence whilst in prison, and the serious nature of his offending, runs counter to a claim of social and cultural integration in the UK. In Binbuga the Court of Appeal specifically held that gang membership tells against social integration and that integration connotes integration as a law-abiding citizen, referring to a 'discontinuity in integration,' by the commission of criminal offences. Further, Binbuga held that rehabilitation carries little or no weight in the proportionality balancing exercise. The tribunal did not take these considerations into account. 34. In his submissions that the First-tier Tribunal failed to carry out a 'broad evaluative judgement,' Mr Lindsay also drew a comparison with the facts in Bossade (ss117A-D interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415 (IAC), where the Upper Tribunal found no very significant obstacles to integration in circumstances where the DRC citizen came to the UK age 4 and lived in the UK for the following 25 years, did not speak Lingala and had no family in the DRC. It was submitted that the claimant is in a stronger position on return than Mr Bossade. 35. Mr Sellwood's submitted that the Article 8 conclusion of very compelling circumstances could survive a finding that the Article 3 assessment was flawed. His submissions largely sought to rely on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, particularly the reports of Dr Kofi and Dr Lackenby. We accept that a holistic approach must be taken to the decision as a whole rather than the piecemeal criticism in some of Mr Lindsay's submissions. However, the issue before us is not whether the available evidence was sufficient to justify the findings made but whether the findings made were sufficient to justify allowing the appeal on either or both Article 3 or Article 8, applying the correct legal principles, or whether the way in which reliance on those findings was approached was flawed so as to amount to a material error of law. 36. Having heard from and taken into account the submissions of both counsel, we accept that the Article 8 assessment and the factors relied on by the judge did in general terms amount to a broad evaluative judgement of the evidence but find that the analysis failed to accord adequate weight to the public interest, whilst giving undue weight to factors in the claimant's favour, at least some of which were either neutral factors or not objectively capable of being accorded significant weight, such as rehabilitation or the fact that the claimant can speak but is not fully fluent in Lingala. 37. Further, it is clear from the wording of paragraph [141] of the decision that in reaching her conclusions on article 8 the judge had regard to the circumstances the claimant would face on return, including that he was not fluent in the local language, before stating, ""taken together I consider that these are compelling circumstances."" Not only did the judge fail to apply the relevant threshold of ""very compelling circumstances,"" but it is clear that the flawed Article 3 findings were so entwined with the Article 8 considerations that it is impossible to separate out a decision which we could find would have justified a judge allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds independently of the flawed Article 3 findings. Mr Sellwood accepted that given the terms of paragraph [141], it would be difficult to sustain his argument that the Article 8 findings could survive independently. It is clear that the entire considerations in relation to both Article 3 and Article 8 will need to be remade.38. In the circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal cannot stand and must be set aside to be remade. Remittal39. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside, section 12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal with directions, or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of primary fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. The errors infecting the First-tier Tribunal decision vitiates all other findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been a valid determination of the issues in the appeal. 40. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, we do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. Decision41. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision should be set aside. We set aside the decision. We remit the appeal to be decided afresh in the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with the attached directions.

5,PA/12260/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/12260/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at: Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On: 29 May 2019 On: 03 June 2019      Before UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KEBEDE Between FC (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE) Appellant and SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr P Blackwood, instructed by Morgan Pearse Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS This case involves a cross-appeal, with both parties appealing the First-tier Tribunal’s decision of 6 February 2019. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 10 February 1960. Following various visits in 2009, July 2014, April 2016, December 2016 and November 2017, the appellant entered the UK on 29 March 2018 and claimed asylum on 16 April 2018. Her claim was refused on 9 October 2018 and her appeal against that decision was heard in the First-tier Tribunal on 20 November 2018. The appellant’s claim can be summarised as follows. In 1997 she moved to Tirana with her husband and two young sons. Her husband purchased a piece of land but the sale had been fraudulent as the seller was not the rightful owner. He came to an agreement with the rightful owner and they made a home on the land. One night a masked man came to their house and threatened to kill them. Four days later the same man returned with two others and he fired 72 bullets at them, leading to her husband’s death in hospital four days later. The appellant was herself shot twice in the leg. Once she was discharged from hospital the appellant took her two children and moved to her husband’s family home. Six months after her husband’s murder three men were arrested and all were convicted. The appellant testified at their trial and identified one of them, AL, as having been the masked intruder who had later killed her husband. One of the men was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and another to six months. AL was sentenced to 23 years. Two of his relatives came to speak to the appellant and to her brother asking to settle the matter by withdrawing her claim but she refused. AL was released from prison in 2016. In December 2016 a stone was thrown through the window of their third floor apartment. Three days later her neighbour told her that two men had asked her which apartment belonged to her and a week later, on 30 November 2016, two men banged on her door at half past midnight and shouted at her to open the door, but she did not. She reported the matter to the police and went to the town council who dealt with reconciliations but they said they were unable to help. On 26 February 2018 an attempt was made to kidnap her when she was waiting at a bus stop but a young man helped her and took her to the police station and then to her home. Her brother told her that this was the last time that she could bring such problems to his home and her neighbour told her that she could not stay there. She left Albania and came to the UK. She believed that a blood feud had been declared against her as a result of her refusing to withdraw her testimony against the three men. The respondent accepted, from the documents produced by the appellant, that her husband had been murdered by the three men but did not accept her account of threats and harassment from the men and did not accept that she was the victim of a blood feud. The respondent did not accept that the appellant was at risk on return to Albania either on account of a blood feud or as a lone female. It was considered in any event that there was sufficiency of protection available to the appellant and that she could internally relocate to another part of Albania. It was not accepted that the appellant’s removal to Albania would breach her human rights. The appellant’s appeal against that decision was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke. The judge commented that the murder of the appellant’s husband was particularly brutal and noted that the murder had happened in front of the appellant’s children and that the appellant had been shot twice in the legs. The judge noted that the appellant had produced a number of documents as proof of her claim and accepted that she was a key eye witness in the trial of the three men and helped secure their convictions. The judge referred to records of reports made by the appellant to the police, in respect of the incidents on 30 November 2018 and 26 February 2018 and a document entitled “certificate” from the Mufti of Diber dated 25 November 2016 confirming the appellant’s husband’s murder. The judge accepted that the documents were consistent with the appellant’s claim and accepted that the appellant had been harassed by AL. The judge noted the reference to a blood feud in the letter from the Mufti of Diber as well as in a letter dated 30 November 2017 from the Head of the Administration Unit of Peshkopi and noted that a letter dated 23 November 2017 from the Head of the Administration Unit of Maqellare confirmed that they could not offer the appellant protection. However, with reference to the country guidance in EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 348, the judge did not accept that the appellant’s situation constituted a blood feud but that it was a matter of a criminal gang who had murdered her husband and who now harassed her and that she was a victim of criminal behaviour. The judge did not accept that the appellant was a member of a particular social group as a victim of a blood feud or as a lone female and did not accept that she had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Neither did the judge accept that the appellant qualified for humanitarian protection or that Articles 2 and 3 applied, as he concluded that there was a sufficiency of protection available to her from the Albanian authorities. With regard to Article 8, however, the judge found that there were very significant obstacles to the appellant reintegrating into life in Albania for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the immigration rules, based upon the trauma of her past experiences, her mental health problems, her fear of AL and his criminal associates and the harassment she experienced from them. The judge found that accordingly the appellant’s removal to Albania amounted to a disproportionate interference with her Article 8 rights and he allowed the appeal on that basis. He dismissed the appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds. Both parties sought permission to appeal against the respective decisions of the judge. With regard to the judge’s decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds, the respondent relied, in his grounds, upon the case of Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 and asserted that the judge’s findings on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) were insufficiently reasoned. As for the decision to dismiss the appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds, the appellant’s grounds asserted that the judge had erred in his identification of a particular social group (PSG); that the judge had made a material misdirection of law in finding that the appellant was the victim of criminal behaviour and not a blood feud and that his analysis of the EH blood feuds factors was incomplete; and that the judge had erred in finding that the Albanian state was unable and/or unwilling to protect the appellant. Permission was granted to the respondent by the First-tier Tribunal and also by the Upper Tribunal to the appellant on the last two grounds. Appeal hearing and submissions Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge had erred in law in his consideration of the factors in EH and that the documentary evidence referring to a blood feud should have been properly addressed as supporting the appellant’s case. Mr Blackwood referred to the Home Office Country Policy and Information Note (CPIN) on “Albania: Blood feuds” version 3.0 dated October 2018 which in turn referred, at paragraph 3.4.4, to the conclusion in the Cedoca report 2017, in regard to the difficulties in defining a blood feud. As for the second ground of appeal, Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge had erred in his consideration of sufficiency of protection. He referred to Horvath v. Secretary of State For The Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 in that regard and submitted that the presumption of innocence arising in the case of Osman v. United Kingdom - 23452/94 [1998] ECHR 101 was not applicable in the appellant’s case as her husband’s killer was not presumed innocent. There was ample evidence that the killer was ruthless and determined. The Albanian state had a duty to protect the appellant but failed to take steps to protect her after she reported the harassment to them. The judge, in finding that there was a sufficiency of protection, relied upon the actions of the police in relation to the appellant’s husband’s murder, but did not address the appellant’s fear of her own murder. Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge’s decision on the appellant’s asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 2 and 3 claims ought accordingly to be set aside and re-made. Mr Lindsay relied upon the CPIN in submitting that the judge was correct in reaching the conclusion that he did as to the existence of a blood feud. He referred to paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of the CPIN in regard to the evolution of blood feuds and the fact that they were declining and were often just criminal acts. He submitted that the letters upon which the appellant relied were reflected by those parts of the CPIN and supported the judge’s finding that this was a matter of criminals trying to seek revenge rather than a blood feud. As for the second ground, Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge reached a sustainable decision and that the appellant was simply seeking to re-argue the matter. In regard to the respondent’s grounds of appeal in relation to Article 8, Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge had provided insufficient reasoning as to why the factors mentioned at [104] and [105] of his decision amounted to very significant obstacles to integration for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), and that those factors were not rationally capable of meeting the terms of Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813. Mr Blackwood submitted that the respondent’s submissions did not reflect the grounds of appeal which were based upon Shizad. The judge undertook a broad evaluative judgment and the findings made were open to him on the evidence. The judge set out the obstacles to integration which included the effect of the trauma of witnessing her husband’s murder with her children. The GP’s letter confirmed her mental health issues arising from the incident. The judge was entitled to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds. Mr Blackwood responded to Mr Lindsay’s submissions on the interpretation of a blood feud and sufficiency of protection, relying on the references in the Cedoca report to the Albanian authorities being insufficiently active in prevention of crimes and addressing blood feuds. Consideration and findings I do not find the grounds of challenge to be made out for either party. It seems to me that the grounds, as put to me at the hearing, amount to little more than disagreements with the judge’s decision. Mr Blackwood’s submission in regard to the findings on the existence of a blood feud was that the judge failed to explain why the letters produced by the appellant, which specifically referred to the existence of a blood feud, were not accepted as supporting the case that a blood feud existed and why the appellant’s case was not accepted as meeting the relevant factors in EH in that regard. The letters referred to are as follows. At page 46 to 48 of the appellant’s appeal bundle, a “Certificate” dated 25 November 2016 from the Mufti of Diber on behalf of the Muslim Community of Albania confirming in the last paragraph: “Situated in this drama, Madam FC and her sons are endangered by blood feud phenomenon as this phenomenon is a widespread drama in Albania.” At pages 49 to 52, a “Record” dated 30 November 2016 from the Dibra District Prosecutor’s Office of the appellant’s report to the police of the incident on 29 November 2016 in which she refers to her family being in a blood feud. At pages 54 to 55, an “Attestation” dated 30 November 2016 from the Chairman of the Administrative Unit of Peshkopi stating that “Mrs FC is seriously endangered by the phenomenon of blood feud” and that “we cannot defend the life of this respected citizen”. At pages 56 to 57, an “Attestation” dated 2 December 2016 from the Mayor of the Municipality of Diber referring to the “conflict between the parties” continuing. The judge referred to these documents at [81], when considering whether the harassment against the appellant amounted to a blood feud. At [82] the judge went on to consider the factors set out in EH at paragraph 74(f) which are to be applied in determining whether a blood feud exists and at [86] he considered the factors in paragraph 74(g) of EH. Having assessed all the evidence, the judge then provided reasons for concluding that the circumstances did not amount to a blood feud. Whilst the judge did not specifically respond to the references in the various official letters to a blood feud, it is undeniably the case that he had regard to those letters in making his findings. It is to be noted that [9] of EH states that such documents “may” assist in establishing the existence of a blood feud and, furthermore, I find myself in agreement with Mr Lindsay that the relevant issue is not so much whether the authorities consider it appropriate to use such a term but whether the term of “blood feud” is correct in this jurisdiction. I also agree with Mr Lindsay that the paragraphs in the CPIN to which he referred support the judge’s analysis of the appellant’s circumstances, in particular at paragraph 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, and specifically: 3.3.1: “… Alfred Koçobashi stated that blood feud still occurs “when someone innocent, a third party has to pay the price for the damage a family member has done, but he added that since the 1990s it is not about honour anymore. 80% is criminal and not related to customary law or medieval common law. It’s about mafia-style killings. It’s murder cases for other reasons than blood feud, just like they happen elsewhere. It’s normal killings or vendetta killings.” Elsa Ballauri from the Albanian Human Rights Group (AHRG) also referred to the transformation of blood feud: …She also declared: “It’s more a justification nowadays because they are committing crimes and they say: ‘I did it for blood feud’. But for me, none of the cases after the 1990s is a real blood feud case.”” 3.3.2: ‘The General Director from the Albanian State Police also stated that revenge cases, that most often are the consequence of criminal problems and individual conflicts or disputes, can happen to everyone and everywhere and are very often wrongly labelled as blood feud… ‘” In the circumstances I find no error of law in the judge’s assessment of whether a blood feud existed and in his conclusion that the events were related to criminal activity and amounted to a criminal vendetta rather than a blood feud. Accordingly I uphold his decision in that regard. Turning to the question of sufficiency of protection, I accept the point being made by Mr Blackwood, namely that the issue was not that the Albanian authorities had demonstrated a willingness to take action against the appellant’s husband’s killers, but whether they were willing and able to take preventative measures to prevent the appellant’s murder. Mr Blackwood relied upon the letters from the Albanian authorities in submitting that they were not able to take such measures, that the police had not taken action against AL and his associates when they harassed the appellant and that the judge ought to have concluded as such on the evidence. The appellant’s grounds at [34] challenge in particular the judge’s finding at [85] of his decision in relation to a document entitled “Decision for the Non-Initiation of the Criminal Proceeding” from the Judicial Attorney of Diber at page 63 and 64 of the appellant’s appeal bundle. However the judge plainly gave detailed and careful consideration to the matter and had full regard to the implications of the decision in that document, as well as the other documentary evidence, in light of the guidance in Horvath. At [93] to [95] the judge considered the matter further in the context of the background country information, noting the limitations of the Albanian police force but providing cogent reasons for concluding nevertheless that the police would prosecute AL and his associates if there was evidence that they had been involved in harassing the appellant. Plainly the documentary evidence showed that the police investigated the appellant’s allegations of harassment and for the reasons properly given the judge was unarguably entitled to conclude that there was a sufficiency of protection available to the appellant to the Horvath standard. I agree with Mr Lindsay that the challenge to the judge’s decision in this regard is no more than a disagreement with his properly made findings and again I uphold his decision. Turning next to the Secretary of State’s appeal against the judge’s decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds, I agree with Mr Blackwood that, whilst the challenge was said to be on the basis of an insufficiency of reasoning, the submission made by Mr Lindsay strayed into the realms of rationality. In any event I find no merit in either grounds of challenge. At [104] of his decision the judge had full regard to the relevant caselaw in considering the question of very significant obstacles to integration into life in Albania and followed the guidance in Kamara in conducting a “broad evaluative judgment”. At [104] and [105] he gave detailed reasons as to why he reached the conclusions that he did. Whilst the respondent may not agree that those reasons are sufficient to amount to very significant obstacles to integration, there is no dispute as to the facts behind those reasons and the various matters considered by the judge, including the appellant’s mental health, were supported by the evidence. There was no insufficiency of reasoning and neither was there anything irrational about the judge’s conclusions, which were clearly and unarguably based upon the evidence before him. There are accordingly no grounds upon which to conclude that the judge made any error of law in concluding as he did. I therefore uphold the judge’s decision in that respect. DECISION Accordingly, both appeals are dismissed. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a point of law, such that the decision has to be set aside. I do not set aside the decision. The decision to dismiss the appellant’s appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds and to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds therefore stands. Anonymity The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 13 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.

This appeal is subject to an anonymity order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead to members of the public identifying the appellant or his children. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. Introduction2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on 14 July 1976. He is a Kurd and comes from Sulaymaniyeh in the IKR. 3. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2013 as a student with a visa to undertake a PhD at Nottingham University funded by a scholarship from the Baghdad government. His wife and three children joined him in the UK in April 2013. His visa was subsequently extended until 30 January 2018 in order to allow him to complete his studies.4. On 1 November 2017, the appellant claimed asylum based upon his political opinion as a result, he said, of threats due to his political social media posting against the government in the IKR. 5. On 24 April 2018, the Secretary of State refused the appellant's claims for asylum, humanitarian protection and under the ECHR. 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In a determination sent on 23 August 2018, Judge Lever dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds including under Art 8.7. The appellant sought permission to appeal solely against the dismissal of his appeal under Art 8. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal on 28 September 2018 but on 4 December 2018 the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Chalkley) granted the appellant permission to appeal.8. On 29 February 2019, the appeal was initially listed before me as an error of law hearing. At that hearing, the Secretary of State conceded that Judge Lever had failed adequately to consider the appellant's Art 8 claim, in particular the impact of the appellant's removal upon his children specifically his twin boys ('A' and 'M') aged 7 who have been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (""ASD"") and have special educational needs.9. In a determination sent on 13 March 2019, in agreement with the Secretary of State's concession, I set aside Judge Lever's decision in relation to Art 8 directing that the decision be remade by the Upper Tribunal at a further hearing at which further evidence could be submitted in respect of the children's circumstances.The Resumed Hearing10. The appeal was listed before me on 9 May 2019. At that hearing, the appellant was represented by Ms L Profumo and the Secretary of State by Mr C Howells. 11. The sole issue was whether the appellant could establish a breach of Art 8.12. Both representatives sought to admit new evidence under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended). Both applications were unopposed. 13. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Profumo relied upon a report from the special needs school at which the appellant's twins A and M were now placed. 14. In addition, Ms Profumo relied upon in translation a letter from the appellant's former employer, Sulaymaniyeh University - where he had been a lecturer before coming to the UK - which indicated that due to his unauthorised absence from work following the completion of his period of study vacation, if he did not return within 30 days from being abroad, he would be considered as ""resigning"" from his position. That letter is dated 5 May 2018.15. Mr Howells relied upon the CPIN, Iraq: Medical and Healthcare Issues (May 2019); and two news reports printed from the internet concerned, inter alia, with the provision for those with autism in the IKR.16. I heard brief oral evidence from the appellant himself. 17. I heard oral submissions from both Ms Profumo and Mr Howells. Ms Profumo handed up a detailed and helpful skeleton argument setting out the appellant's case.The Issues18. It was common ground between the parties that the appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) either under Appendix FM or on the basis of his private life and para 276ADE. It was also accepted that none of the appellant's children - in addition to the twins he also has a daughter (""S"") aged 13 - nor his wife could succeed under the Rules. 19. A number of matters were common ground between the parties.20. First, the appellant's claim was a claim under Art 8 outside the Rules. Secondly, the appellant's claim was based upon his (and his family's) private life in the UK, in particular the impact upon his twin sons if he were removed to the IKR. The reality in this appeal is that either all the family stay in the UK or all the family leave and return to the IKR. Mr Howells did not suggest otherwise in his submissions. Thirdly, the crucial issue was that of proportionality under Art 8.2. It was not suggested, nor could it be on the basis of the evidence, that Art.8.1 was not engaged based upon the impact upon the family if they returned to the IKR. Both representatives agreed that the crucial issue in determining whether any interference was proportionate was whether there were sufficiently compelling circumstances which would result in ""unjustifiably harsh consequences"" for the appellant or his family (see, R (Agyarko and Another) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 at [60]).The Submissions21. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Howells submitted that s.117B(1) and (5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the ""NIA Act 2002"") was important. As the appellant and his family could not meet any of the requirements of the Rules, the maintenance of effective immigration control was in the public interest by virtue of s.117B(1). Further, the private life of the appellant and his family had been established whilst their immigration status was ""precarious"" and, therefore, should be given ""little weight"" by virtue of s.117B(5).22. Mr Howells recognised that the principal aspect of the appellant's claim related to the impact of removal of his twins, A and M who have a diagnosis of ASD. Mr Howells accepted that the background evidence showed that there was ""limited"" support for autism in the IKR but, he submitted, there was some provision. He referred me to a number of documents. 23. First, he referred me to the ""Cara Report: A Study of Education Opportunities for Disabled Children and Youth and Early Childhood Development (ECD) in Iraq (April 2011)"" at pages CB 40-82 of the appellant's bundle. At CB 73 he referred to a section relating to the IKR under the heading ""schools"" identifying a higher percentage of special needs teachers with formal special needs training showing the ""growing effectiveness of the Kurdistan Inclusion Education Programme (KIEP)"". Then at CB 50, the KIEP programme is discussed including referring to the provision of an ""early learning programme"" for children with disabilities. Then at CB 65-66 further reference is made to special needs teachers, albeit on an Iraq wide basis rather than specifically in the IKR, but also notes that the KIEP nevertheless had opposition from ""some members of the Erbil Provincial Counsel, who view KIEP as pushing a western 'construct'.""24. Secondly, Mr Howells referred to the very recent May 2019 CPIN report at para 15.1.1 referring to the existence of ""private institutions"" for individuals with autism and Downs Syndrome charging $250 monthly. When I enquired of Mr Howell whether this related to the IKR or the remainder of Iraq, he was unable to assist.25. Thirdly, he referred me to the two newspaper reports arising out of 'World Autism Awareness Day' in 2019 and the provision of ""twenty autism-designed centers in the Kurdistan region, seventeen of which are private."" He accepted however that provision did not meet demand. Mr Howells was unable to assist as to whether these ""autism-designed centers"" provided education or, as would appear from the text, some form of ""treatment"" for children with autism.26. Mr Howells submitted that the appellant could generate income in order to allow his twins to attend one of these autism-designed centers. He had been a lecturer in Sulaymaniyeh University and now had a PhD. 27. Mr Howells submitted that, despite what the appellant said in his evidence, it was likely that the children had, at least initially, spoken Kurdish before and not just, as the appellant claimed, and the recent report stated, they now spoke English. 28. Mr Howells submitted that, having regard to all these circumstances, there were no compelling circumstances giving rise to unjustifiably harsh consequences to the family, in particular the twin boys, A and M so as to outweigh the public interest. 29. Ms Profumo relied upon her very detailed skeleton argument. She submitted that the twin had initially been in a mainstream school but had even there they had required 1:1 support. It had been recommended that they should have special educational provision and that in September 2018, they had been placed in a specialist school. She referred me to a letter from the head teacher dated 3 April 2019 which indicated that the ratio was six pupils: three adults. But, she submitted it was clear that they still required 1:1 support on specific occasions. 30. Ms Profumo placed considerable reliance upon the report from the specialist school which showed that both A and M were progressing and thriving relative to their progress whilst they were in a mainstream school. She submitted that they were both in a highly supportive environment which would simply not be available in the IKR. She submitted that the background material showed that there was a dearth of special educational provision, albeit that there was some within the mainstream context. There was no evidence that there were any specialist schools of the kind which both A and M required and at which they were placed in the UK. She submitted that the twins could not cope with mainstream school in the UK and they would not be able to do so in the IKR. The evidence about private institution was that they were essentially treatment or support centres. Nothing in the material suggested that they were educational institutions such as the one attended by the twins in the UK. She pointed out that the evidence showed that there were 2,800 cases of children diagnosed with autism in the IKR. The second letter made plain that there was ""not enough support centres or funding to care for them"". She submitted that the private provision was not, in itself, adequate for the children but in any event the appellant would not be able to afford to place his children there. It was expensive and his evidence, which he invited me to accept, was that he was unlikely to be able to obtain a job. 31. She relied not only upon the impact upon A and M but also upon the appellant's daughter, S and his wife. They had been in the UK for over six years, the twins were 1 year old when they came and S was 7. The evidence was, she submitted, that the children spoke English, in particular in the report of the school which the twins now attended.32. She submitted, relying upon matters set out in paras 9-20 of her skeleton in relation to A and M and in para 21 in relation to S and para 22 in relation to the appellant and his wife, that the appellant's removal would not be in the best interests of the three children and, particularly having regard to the impact upon A and M, there were sufficiently compelling circumstances to outweigh the public interest as there would be an unjustifiably harsh consequence to them if returned to the IKR. Discussion33. I deal first with the appellant's oral evidence. I accept what he told me. I have no doubt that he was seeking to tell me the truth. He, like his wife, was employed at Sulaymaniyeh University before they came to the UK. I accept his oral evidence supported by the letter dated 7 May 2018, that he has now been sacked. He told me in his oral evidence that two further letters had confirmed that he had been sacked but he had not produced them. Mr Howells did not seek to cross-examine him on this matter to suggest that he was not telling the truth and, as I say, I accept that he has lost his job. I also accept his evidence that his wife has lost her job as well. I accept further that it will be very difficult for them to obtain employment, certainly employment permitting them to afford any private support for their twins A and M, on return to the IKR. I also accept the appellant's evidence that his family in the IKR would not be able to provide the required finance for private support for the twins. I accept his evidence that his three brothers are unemployed, his parents are very old and his two sisters are married living with their husbands and family. None are employed and they are uneducated. 34. Ms Profumo helpfully set out the evidence concerning M and A at paras 9-16 of her skeleton argument. Mr Howells acknowledged her summary of their circumstances is accurate. They have both been diagnosed with ASD and suffer from sensory and developmental needs. The appellant's own evidence, which I accept, was that: ""everything is difficult for them, eating, changing clothes, going to the toilet?if they meet strangers who do not understand how to deal with autism, they cry, they shout, sometimes they run away"".35. Both children have, until September of last year, been in a mainstream school. They have been assessed as requiring special educational needs, including 1:1 teacher support. The needs of M are more acute than those of his brother A. As I have said, Mr Howells acknowledged as accurate Ms Profumo's summary of M and A's circumstances set out at paras 11-14 of her skeleton argument. There, she very carefully, and in detail by reference to the documents upon which she places reliance, sets out their circumstances. I accept what she sets out and I gratefully adopt it (with removal of her emphasis and identifying information, and with some typographical/citation corrections) as part of my decision. (The reference to the ""EHCP"" reviews in relation to both M and A is to their respective ""Education, Health & Care Plan"" review in the appellant's bundle (""AB"").) ""11, The EHCP review of [M], dated 30 March 2017 [AB/127-137], who suffers from the most acute needs, identifies the following concerns:i. He shows no awareness or interest in other children and reciprocal activities [AB/A129&130].ii. His speech is unclear and easier to understand by adults 'tuned into him' [A129].iii. He continues to require 1:1 support to facilitate access to all areas of curriculum, as well as for health and safety [AB/A135].iv. He requires help to dress and undress [AB/A131].v. Continues to require close supervision and clear explicit boundaries to remain safe at all times [AB/A131].vi. ""As the gap between [M] and his peers widens, his reliance on an adult to access the curriculum at [?] is unlikely to reduce which will impact on [M's] ability to develop greater independence"" [AB/135].vii. His progress has been minimal despite the high level of sustained support he receives [AB/A135].viii. The school does not have the capacity to meet [M's] needs appropriately or to provide the level of support he requires to increase to his time to a full-time place [AB/A132].ix. [M] requires a specialist school setting, with smaller class sizes, a higher ratio of staff support, and a peer group with similar needs with whom he is best placed to access learning [AB/A135].x. The benefits of a move to specialist school would be ""greater focus on communication, interaction, and life skills"", and in the long-term greater independence on reduced reliance on an adult [AB/A135].12. The parallel EHCP review of [A] [AB/A146-154] identifies the following concerns:i. He does not initiate or respond to peers [AB/A148].ii. Even with his 1:1 support, it is difficult for him to remain seated for more than 2-3 minutes [A149].iii. He will take every opportunity to test the boundaries [A150].iv. He continues to need 1:1 full time support to engage in curriculum activities and for health and safety [AB/A152].v. ""As the gap between [A] and his peers widens, his reliance on an adult to access the curriculum at [?] is unlikely to reduce which will impact on [M's] ability to develop greater independence"" [AB/A153]vi. The school does not have the capacity to meet [A's] needs appropriately or to provide the level of support he requires to increase his time to a full-time place [AB/A151].vii. [A] requires a specialist school setting as [?] unable to provide an environment and curriculum conducive to his progress; he would benefit from smaller, specialist classes with peers with similar needs [AB/A153].13. The twins were thereafter admitted to [?] Primary School, a mainstream school in Bristol, on 11 September 2017, where they are similarly supported with SEN [see letter from SENDco, Ms Williams, at AB/A126]. When the family relocated to Cardiff in February 2018, the local authority re-investigated the children's education needs, with the following observations:""these two boys are very complex and would not do well in a local mainstream school even with full time 1:1 teaching assistant support. They are both very limited verbally (echolalic and key words), PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) users, can be very challenging and have a very limited sense of danger"".They are definitely special Autistic Spectrum Disorder profile pupils. Being without a school placement and daily routine will also be having a significant impact on their wellbeing"" [see letter from Mr Martin, SEN caseworker, AB/125].14. In view of such needs, Cardiff SEN Casework Team advised [t]hat the twins required specialist educational provision for those on the autism spectrum [AB/125]. This was corroborated by the proposed amended statements of special education needs (date June 2018), which advised:(a) [M]:(i) Unable to independently access any aspect of the curriculum [AB/A190].(ii) Only able to concentrate on activities with a high degree of structure and support [AB/A190].(iii) His speech is unclear and best understood by those families with him [AB/A190].(iv) He doesn't initiate interaction with other children [AB/A190].(v) He suffers from ASD and certain sensory needs, his special educational needs likely due to his communication and language difficulties [AB/A190].(vi) He will require specialist education provision that provides a high level of individual/small group teaching, with a high adult-pupil ratio, and staff experienced/trained in managing the needs of children with autism spectrum condition and with appropriate interventions [AB/A191].(vii) He should also have access to a clinical-based Speech & language Therapist [AB/A191].(viii) He will require close supervision for his own safety, and help with his independence skills such as dressing [AB/A192].(ix) There should be close liaison between the school, home and outside agencies to ensure a consistent approach and regularly review [M's] progress [AB/A192].(b) [A]:(i) He has limited speech, requiring adults to model short phrases and develop his language [AB/A199].(ii) He suffers from ASD and his certain sensory needs, his special education needs likely due to his difficulties with his social communication and language [AB/199].(iii) He will require specialist educational provision that provides a high level of individual/small group teaching, with a high adult-pupil ratio, and staff experienced/trained in managing the needs of children with autism spectrum condition and with appropriate interventions [AB/A200].(iv) He should also have access to a clinical-based Speech & Language Therapist [AB/A200].(v) He will require close supervision for his own safety with the school needing to complete a risk assessment [AB/A200].(vi) There should be close liaison between the school, home and outside agencies to ensure a consistent approach and regularly review [A's] progress [AB/A201].""36. Since September 2018, they have attended a specialist school in Cardiff and the position there is summarised at paras 15 and 16 of Ms Profumo's skeleton argument as follows.""15. The twins accordingly started at the [?] Special School in September 2018, a specialist school for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Condition [AB/A125; A186]. ?. further evidence has been submitted?of the twins' most recent annual review at their new school [SB]. [?], the head teacher, confirms both pupils receive their education in a small class setting, with a high adult-pupil ratio (1:2). She observes both children:""have social communication and social interaction challenges and require 1:1 support at specific times of the school day in order to access the curriculum and to develop life skills required within their development stage"" [SB].16. The recent school reviews of both children [SB] confirm they have thrived within their specialist education settings as relative to their progress in the former mainstream schools:(a) [M](i) He has made good progress in engaging with activities.(ii) He benefits from the structured play in the classroom environment and engages well with the individual/class schedules [page 8].(iii) He has made good progress with self-help skills, able to put his coat on and toilet independently.(iv) His numeracy and literacy skills have improved.(b) [A]:(i) He has improved his communication skills, showing a clear understanding of spoken language and using increasingly varied spontaneous language [internal page 7/8].(ii) He has made good progress with his early literacy and numeracy skills [page 9].(v) He is able to complete a variety of tasks, within a ""highly structured environment"" [page 7].(vi) His concentration is developing when engaged in independent learning [page 7].(vii) His social and play skill are developing [page 8].(viii) He is independent with toileting, though still requires supervision [page 9].(ix) Whilst aware of certain sensory aspects, he remains unaware of the danger so his actions [10].""37. I accept Ms Profumo's submission that the position of M and A has improved at a specialist school for those with a diagnosis of ASD where they obtain a high level of support including where necessary 1:1 support. The level of support is patently high and the improvement is over, an already significant level of special needs provision, which they previously received whilst they were in a mainstream school.38. It is clear to me on the evidence that the level of support that is required and which they receive in the UK will simply not be available in the IKR. Added to which, I accept the appellant's evidence that they only speak English. The confusion of being in a situation where a foreign language (to them) is being spoken can only, on any reading of the material concerned with their particular circumstances, have a deleterious effect upon them. 39. Although Mr Howells sought to identify from the background material support that would be available to the twins in the IKR, he candidly accepted it was ""limited"". The special needs support in mainstream schools is very limited indeed. Ms Profumo referred, as para 18 of her skeleton argument, to a CBS news report, albeit dated 10 August 2008, where it was said that ""the problem for autistic children in Iraq?is that nothing is known about this condition"". It may be that the more recent material shows some improvement. Nevertheless, the USSD 2007 Report states that: ""There were reports that persons with disabilities experienced discrimination due to social stigma?local NGO's reported many children with disabilities dropped out of public school due to insufficient physical access to school buildings, a lack of appropriate learning materials in schools, and a shortage of teachers qualified to work with children of developmental or intellectual disabilities.""40. Whilst the Cara Report recognises that there is some provision within schools in the IKR under the KIEP, it also recognises that there is resistance. The report refers to the ""Average special-needs teacher to special-needs pupil ratio was 1:8, although 14% of the schools visited with special-needs pupils had no special-needs teacher. The remaining 86% had at least one special-education teacher, the majority of whom are female. Most of the special-needs pupils were not integrated within the standard school rooms. Special-needs classes observed were held away from the main classes, and are often located in unsuitable areas within the school building, e.g. in a store room without windows and under a school stairwell. The curriculum being taught was the standard curriculum.""41. This report does not relate exclusively to the IKR although the enquiry included visiting five primary schools in the Erbil governorate (see para 10.9 at CB 65 - 66). It is plain that the provision contemplated would fall far short of that provided to the twins whilst they were being educated in the mainstream in the UK. The latter, however, was insufficient to meet their needs such that they have now been placed in a special needs school where they are provided even more intense and focussed education and support. It is the latter which has resulted in their improvement which Ms Profumo recognised had occurred. They remain, however, desperately in need of that support in order to fulfil their educational and wellbeing needs given their ASD diagnosis. 42. The evidence relied upon by Mr Howells in the two newspaper reports provides little support for any educational provision sufficient to meet the twins needs. Seventeen of the autism designed centers are private. Only three in the IKR are state supported. There is a very real danger that the twins will not be able to access the state provision. I accept the appellant's evidence that he would not be able to afford to send them to the private autism-designed centers whether the cost is US$250 monthly per child or, as the appellant said, he believed, US$500 monthly. The second news report makes the prospect of the twins obtaining the support provided by these centres most unlikely. It states: ""Nearly 1,000 children with autism live in Erbil province, but there is only one center for treatment. It currently cares for 32 children?""43. In any event, it is wholly unclear from these news reports what is the actual provision to children who attend one of the autism-designed centers. The reports speak of ""treatment"" received at the centers. It is far from clear that they are the educational equivalent of what was being received by the twins in mainstream education in the UK, let alone in the specialist school that they now attend and in which they are, on all the evidence I have seen, thriving and doing much better in their development and education. 44. Although I do take into account the impact upon the appellant, his wife and 13 year old daughter if they were removed to the IKR, at least as regards the appellant and his wife, I agree that s.117B(5) means that ""little weight"" should be given to their private life. It may well be also that although S is 13 and has lived in the UK since she was 7, her best interests would be to live with her parents in IKR if they return there in that it would be reasonable to expect her to return with them (see, KO (Nigeria) and Another v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 at [18]). That, however, cannot be said of M and A. It is clearly, in my judgment, in their best interest to remain in the UK given the deleterious effect upon them as a result of the removal of their education and other support for the ASD which would, in my judgment, in all likelihood occur if they return to the IKR. A and M were 1-year old when they came to the UK and they are now 7 years of age. Whilst their private life was also formed whilst their immigration status was ""precarious"", their circumstances (particularly bearing in mind their diagnosis of ASD) falls, in my judgment, for the flexible application of s.117B(5) read with s.117A(2)(a) recognised by the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58 at [49]. There are in my judgment, ""particularly strong features"" relating to their private life and their circumstances which justify giving due weight to the impact upon their private life if removed.45. I am satisfied that the impact upon A and M if removed to the IKR would be substantial, significant and highly deleterious to their education and developmental progress as a result of their ASD. Their current progress would, in all likelihood, be 'stopped in its tracks' resulting in behavioural and other detriments to them which would, necessarily, have a considerable impact upon their family, in particular their parents who would be caring for them. In my judgment, that impact amounts to sufficiently compelling circumstances because of the unjustifiably harsh consequences removal would have for the family, but in particular for A and M in the IKR. As a result, I am satisfied that the circumstances I have set out above outweigh the public interest such that A and M's removal would be a disproportionate interference with their private life. Their removal would breach Art 8 of the ECHR. As it has never been suggested that the appellant, his wife and S should leave the UK if A and M's removal would breach Art 8, the reality is that all of the family cannot lawfully be removed from the UK in accordance with Art 8 of the ECHR. 46. I accordingly remake the decision and allow the appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.Decision47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal on international protection and humanitarian protection grounds stands.48. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal under Art 8 was set aside in the Upper Tribunal's decision sent on 13 March 2019.49.

The appellant was born on 6 June 1993 and is a male citizen of Iran. By a decision dated 7 March 2018, the Secretary of State refused his application for international protection. By a decision promulgated on 19 December 2018, the First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal. The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.2. I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. My reasons for reaching a decision are as follows. First, the decision contains factual errors which is likely have influenced the judge's assessment of the credibility of the appellant's account. At [7], the judge states that:""The question of whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution? must be looked at in the round in the light of all the relevant circumstances and judged against the situation as at the time of the hearing of the appeal particularly and although, as in this case, there is a considerable history of similar application, adverse decisions and unsuccessful appeal?""3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2017. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was his first challenge to the only refusal of his claim for protection. It is simply not the case that there has been a 'considerable history' of previous adverse decisions and unsuccessful appeals. I consider that it is likely that the judge's approach to the credibility of the appellant as a witness has been influenced by this misunderstanding of the facts.4. Secondly, the appellant relied upon an expert report from Dr Kakhki. In his assessment of the report, the judge has fallen into an error of methodology. He states at [15] the expert 'opines upon the level of risk the appellant might face if returned to Iran subjected him coming up to proof on the facts he seeks to rely upon.' Later, at [23], the judge remarks that the report of the expert 'expresses opinion as to risk dependent on an appellant coming up to proof of his assertions which is not happened in this case. I am not bound by or persuaded by [the expert's] report impressive and learn it though it be.' As Mrs Wawaha, who appeared for the appellant, pointed out, the expert report offers helpful background information regarding country conditions in Iran which are not conditional upon the appellant's account being found credible but which the judge has ignored solely because he found that the appellant had not 'come up to proof.' The judge's rejection entirely of the report and its contents for the reason he is given amounts to an error of law.5. Thirdly, the judge failed to have regard to parts of the appellant's account which the Secretary of State had accepted as true and accurate in the refusal letter. At [53] of that letter, the respondent accepts the appellant's nationality and his 'smuggling activities.' Notwithstanding that acceptance of part of the account, the judge at [17] mischaracterises the respondent's case before the Tribunal by wrongly asserting that respondent did not accept that appellant had been 'a smuggler in the border region.' 6. Fourthly, in his analysis of the appellant's account, the judge unreasonably finds against the appellant in part because he was unable to produce corroborative evidence of parts of his account. I accept that it was reasonable for the judge to note that the appellant had not produced evidence from PJAK representatives in Iran or the United Kingdom to endorse his claim to be a supporter of that organisation but the judge did err at [20.4] when he indicates that the credibility of the account is diminished because there was 'no supporting evidence to show that [the appellant] had been ambushed whilst portering PJAK goods and his accompanying cousin wounded and arrested.' The judge makes no attempt to specify what 'supporting evidence' he expects to be produced of this event which, by its nature, is unlikely to have been reported in the media whilst those who witnessed it are unlikely to be willing or able to provide evidence in court proceedings in the United Kingdom. 7. In the light of what I have said above, I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. The errors go to the core of the Tribunal's analysis of credibility; in the circumstances, it will be necessary to return the appeal to a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.Notice of DecisionThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 19 December 2018 is set aside. None of the findings of fact shall stand.

This is the claimant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with the permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (the Tribunal) which it made on 26 October 2018 following a of hearing of 23 October 2018 and which it sent to the parties on 16 November 2018. The Tribunal's decision was to dismiss the claimants appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State of 25 February2018, to refuse grant him international protection.2. I have decided to grant the claimant anonymity. Anonymity was granted by the Tribunal and it does seem to me that it is appropriate to continue that grant. 3. Shorn of all but the essential detail, the claimant's account of the events said to underpin his claim to be entitled to international protection may be summarised as follows: He is a national of Iran, of Kurdish ethnicity and he was born on 4 May 1997. His father was a Peshmerga. He lived in the Sardasht area of Iran and started to support a pro-Kurdish oppositionist party by delivering leaflets. But in due course he received a letter from the Etellaat asking him to attend their offices. His uncle advised him not to attend because he was aware of two other persons who had received a similar invitation and who had subsequently gone missing. Instead, fearing the authorities and or those associated with them, the claimant fled Iran with the assistance of his uncle. He says he was taken to an airport where he boarded a plane for the United Kingdom (UK). He also says that he will be persecuted or subjected to serious harm by the authorities or by groups associated with the authorities if he is to be returned to Iran.4. The Secretary of State disbelieved the claimant and so did the Tribunal. The Tribunal, essentially, thought he had provided inconsistent evidence with respect to the claimed leafleting; thought he given only vague information regarding his claimed involvement with the oppositionist party; thought the information he had given as to how he had been recruited by the party conflicted with background country material; and thought he had given an unconvincing account of his claimed journey to the UK. In seeking permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal it was argued that the Tribunal had had regard to background country material relating to a different oppositionist party to that which the claimant had claimed to have been involved with (ground one); had breached the ""Surendran guidelines"" by taking a point concerning what it thought to be the vagueness of key aspects of his account without putting its concerns (ground two); and in failing to make any finding as to his ""political opinion per se"" notwithstanding its disbelief of the detail of the account and in also failing to take account of his families claimed previous involvement with the oppositionist party prior to rejecting the appellants own claim to have had such involvement.5. The granting judge made an unlimited grant of permission to appeal but clearly thought the most arguable contention was that concerning the claimed confusion on the part of the Tribunal with respect to the party the claimant had said he belonged to. Permission having been granted the case was listed for an oral hearing before the Upper Tribunal (before me) so that consideration could be given to the question of whether or not the Tribunal had erred in law and, if it had, what should flow from that. Representation at that hearing was as stated above and I am grateful to each representative. 6. Ms Khan pursued with vigour the various points which had been made in the grounds of appeal. Mr Diwnycz accepted there had been some confusion (which he thought might have been caused by what had been said in the Secretary of States written decision) regarding the specific party which the claimant had claimed to be a member of. He suggested that such might have the Tribunal into error. He did not formally concede but made it clear he did not wish to defend the decision of the Tribunal. In truth, he came as close to conceding without actually using such a word as it is possible to do. 7. The Upper Tribunal is not bound by even a clear concession made in terms by a party. But it is difficult to disregard what, to my mind, effectively amounted to one. A considered stance taken by a representative is not something that should be simply ignored. Mr Diwnycz is a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer and in the circumstances, I have attached some weight to his deliberate stance in not seeking to defend the Tribunal's decision. I do not know if, had the case been argued differently or if a different stance had been taken on behalf of the Secretary of State, I would have reached the same or a different view. But I have decided in the circumstances as set out above that the Tribunal did make an error of law which might have impacted the outcome of the appeal. I have decided, therefore, to set aside the Tribunal's decision.8. There is more than one oppositionist party in Iran. The acronyms used for some of them in this case have proved rather confusing. I agree with Mr Diwnycz that what was said by the Secretary of State in his written decision of 25 February 2018 did not necessarily clarify matters in the way that it could have done. But there is a party which appears to be most commonly known as or referred to as PDKI although other acronyms are sometimes used for that party. I shall from now on simply refer to it as the ""original party"". There is another oppositionist party which appears to be commonly referred to as the KDP-I (though there may be different acronyms for that too) which is an offshoot of the original party. I shall call it the ""offshoot party"". 9. The Secretary of State, in his written decision, thought that the claimant's credibility had been damaged by his confusing the two parties with each other. Whether that is so or not is something which will in due course, be assessed by another Tribunal. But by the time the matter was before the Tribunal the claimant had attempted, on my reading (though the way it is put in the witness statement of 28 March 2018 is confusing) to indicate that he had been involved with the offshoot party and not the original party. So, whether that was true or not, that was his position to the Tribunal. 10. I accept the Tribunal did not appreciate that attempt at clarification though that may be because it was given in a way which itself might have lacked clarity. I accept that the background country material it relied upon in concluding that the claimant had given an implausible account as to how he came to be recruited, was concerned with the original party rather than the offshoot party. I have very considerable sympathy with the Tribunal because, as I say, I do not think matters were stated as clearly as they could have been by the Secretary of State. Nor, in fact, do I think that matters had been stated as clearly as they could have been by or on behalf of the claimant either. But nevertheless, bearing in mind Mr Diwnycz's conciliatory stance, I have decided that the Tribunal did err in considering background country material which related to the wrong party and that it wrongly applied that material to the claimant's account as to how he was recruited. 11. Of course, as indicated above, the Tribunal had also found other reasons to disbelieve the claimant. Some of those have been the subject of further challenge but I have not found any such challenges to be persuasive. In particular, I do not accept that the Tribunal was required to send some sort of signal as to its concerns prior to concluding that the claimant had given a vague account of his claimed political activity. The Surendran guidelines do suggest that if a new point is to be taken by the Tribunal in the absence of the representative for the Secretary of State, that should be put. But in my view the Tribunal was not taking a new point at all. It is true that vagueness which concerned it had not been expressed as a specific concern in the Secretary of State's decision letter. But the Secretary of State had disbelieved the account, the claimant was represented before the Tribunal, it was for the claimant to present an account concerning sufficient detail and in those circumstances the Tribunal was, in my judgement, entitled (though it did not have to) to take an adverse point with respect to vagueness without sending such a signal. To argue otherwise simply takes the relevant part of the Surendran guidelines much too far12. Nevertheless, I am not wholly satisfied that had the Tribunal not erred in applying the background material relating to the wrong party, it would inevitably have reached the same conclusion as to the claimant's veracity. In the circumstances (and really by consent) I have decided to set aside the Tribunal's decision on that basis. 13. Ms Khan sought remittal. Mr Diwnycz did not urge to me take a different course. So, I have decided to remit. There will, therefore, be a rehearing of the appeal before a differently constituted tribunal where all matters of fact and law will be considered afresh. Perhaps it might assist if the parties, in order to avoid further confusion, dispense with the acronyms referred to above and simply refer to the original party and the offshoot party as I have done, but that is up to them.14. My having decided to remit I am statutorily obligated to give directions for the remaking of the decision. But I do not need to give detailed ones. Accordingly, I simply direct that there be a complete rehearing before a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal (a different judge). Any other directions are best made by the First-tier Tribunal itself.DecisionThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law and is set aside. Further, the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing. The First-tier Tribunal granted the claimant anonymity. I continue that grant pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Accordingly, no report of these proceedings shall name or otherwise identify the claimant or any member of his family. This grant applies to all parties to the proceedings. Failure to comply may lead to contempt of court proceedings.Signed Dated 28 May 2019MR HemingwayJudge of the Upper Tribunal",2019-06-03
9,HU/08759/2017," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal no: HU/08759/2017 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at: Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 14 May 2019 On 3rd June 2019   Before: The Hon Mrs Justice WHIPPLE DBE and Upper Tribunal Judge John FREEMAN Between: Secretary of State for the Home Department Appellant and Mohd. MOINUL ISLAM Respondent Representation: For the appellant: Miss Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer For the respondent: Mr M S Gill QC, instructed by Taj Solicitors DECISION AND REASONS Introduction This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Ceridwen Griffith), sitting at Hendon Magistrates’ Court on 28 November 2018,. Judge Griffith allowed the appeal by a citizen of Bangladesh born on 9 October 1989 on human rights grounds. That appeal was in response to the Secretary of State’s decision to deport him because he is a foreign criminal. We shall continue to refer to him as the Appellant even though he is the respondent to this appeal. The Appellant is now 29 years old. He is a single man with no dependants. He came to the UK on 10 July 1993, a few months before his 4th birthday. He was granted indefinite leave to remain until 7 June 1994. The Appellant has a history of offending. Between 2006 (when he was still a minor) until 2012 (when he turned 23) he was convicted on 14 occasions of 20 offences, ranging from offences against the person to theft, carrying an offensive weapon and drug offences. The index offence which triggered the automatic deportation proceedings was committed in 2009, when the Appellant was aged 20 or so. He was convicted on two counts of supplying cocaine, a class A drug, and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment of which he served twelve months. He was released from prison in 2010. The Appellant applied to be naturalised as a British citizen in April 2013 but that application was refused because he did not meet the Good Character requirement. A deportation order was served on him on 11 June 2015 and an application on human rights grounds was refused on 13 October 2015. The deportation order was signed the same day. There were various challenges to that order. On 14 June 2017, the decision dated 13 October 2015 was withdrawn as was the original deportation order. A fresh deportation decision was made; the Appellant’s fresh human rights claim was refused on 2 August 2017. The Appellant had an in-country right of appeal against that decision. He exercised his right of appeal to the FtT. By a decision promulgated on 20 December 2018, Judge Griffith allowed that appeal and declared the deportation decision unlawful on human rights grounds. The Secretary of State now appeals against that determination. The FtT’s reasons Judge Griffith recorded that the Appellant comes from a large family with 7 siblings, four of whom were born in this country. The Appellant’s evidence, which was accepted, was that his father had died when he was 12, which is an event which he said had seriously affected him and had caused him to associate with a bad crowd; he had now been free of crime for 6 years, and intended to stay that way. In short he had turned his life around. He had only been to Bangladesh once, with his father in 2001 (when he was 12 years old). He has no family in Bangladesh and no one to ask for help. He lives at home with his family. He speaks the Sylheti dialect of the Bangali language which is not the same as the official language spoken in Bangladesh, which he can neither speak nor write. He did not know that he had a Bangladeshi passport and had always considered himself to be British. His appeal was supported by evidence from his mother and two of his sisters (see paras [72] - [75]). The Appellant advanced two bases for his appeal, both of which arise out of s 117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which we set out in relevant part here: “(3) In the case of a foreign criminal (“C”) who has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies. (4) Exception 1 applies where— (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of C's life, (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration into the country to which C is proposed to be deported. (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.” First, the Appellant argued that he was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner in the UK who was a “qualifying partner” for the purposes of exception 2 (s 117C(5)). Judge Griffith rejected that submission on the evidence (para [70]) and there is no appeal to us against that finding. Secondly, the Appellant argued that his right to private life under Article 8 outweighed the public interest in his deportation as a foreign criminal, relying on exception 1 (s 117C(4), read with para 399A of the Immigration Rules). Judge Griffith considered each of the three limbs of exception 1. There was no dispute that that Appellant satisfied the first limb because he had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life (para [71]). On the second limb, Judge Griffith accepted that the Appellant’s criminal past was not, on the evidence, an indication that he was not socially and culturally integrated in the UK – after all, the Appellant had long believed he was British and had not realised at the time of commission of these crimes that he held a Bangladeshi passport. Judge Griffith accepted that the Appellant had only visited Bangladesh once and had no real connection with that country. She found that the Appellant’s involvement in crime was not evidence of a failure of integration; the Appellant therefore met the second limb of exception 1, because he was socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom (paras [72]-[73]). Judge Griffith turned to limb 3. She found that the Appellant would be a stranger and an outsider were he to return to Bangladesh, in the absence of any real ties to that country. He had only returned once for three months at the age of 12, and that was insufficient to build any form of cultural tie to that country. He cannot read or write the main language of the country and would be disadvantaged in finding work or accommodation. There were no family members in Bangladesh who could help him. He has no real employment history to rely on to enable him to find employment in that country. He receives help from family in the UK but even if that continued, it would not be sufficient to overcome the other difficulties he would face as an outsider (see para [74]-[75]). Judge Griffith then reminded herself of the public interest factors. She recognised the significance of the Appellant’s offending and the general public interest in deporting foreign criminals. But she also noted that this Appellant’s offending was historic, some of it committed while he was a minor in circumstances where he had fallen in with a bad crowd. She concluded that the Appellant fell within the category of individuals where the public interest in deportation was outweighed by countervailing factors under Article 8, that category being identified by s 117C(4) (exception 1) and para 399A. The public interest did not require the Appellant to be deported (para [76]-[78]). Judge Griffith identified a further public interest factor, namely the delay in taking deportation action against the Appellant. The index offence was committed in 2010 but no deportation action taken until 2015. Further, the Appellant had now been free of crime for six years which diminished the public interest in deportation (para [79]). She allowed the appeal (para [80]). Appeal The Secretary of State advances a number of grounds of appeal (which we summarise): That the FtT was irrational in concluding that there were very significant obstacles to the Appellant reintegrating into Bangladesh; That the FtT was in error in concluding that the Appellant was an “outsider”; That the FtT failed to give adequate consideration to the seriousness of the Appellant’s criminal conduct which was not mere juvenile delinquency given that he continued to offend as an adult and had been convicted of two further offences since being released from prison on the index conviction for supplying class A drugs. That the FtT failed to give adequate consideration to the public interest in deporting criminals, even if there has not been any recent reoffending. That the FtT had failed to give clear reasons for its decision. By a skeleton argument drafted by Mr T Lindsay of the Secretary of State’s Specialist Appeals Team in advance of the appeal hearing, the Secretary of State raised a new point relating to limb 2 of exception 1, namely that Judge Griffith was wrong on the authorities to reject the Appellant’s past criminality as evidence of lack of social and cultural integration in the UK. However, as Mr Gill pointed out, the grounds of appeal did not contain any challenge which related to Judge Griffith’s findings on limb 2, and therefore, he argued, this point was simply not open to t he Secretary of State on th is appeal. After hearing from Miss Isherwood, we upheld Mr Gill’s objection. Th e particular point of challenge on limb 2 was not heralded in the Secretary of State’s grounds of appeal; it had been raised for the first time in a skeleton argument served just before the hearing, but apparently not seen by Mr Gill, for whatever reason, before he came into the hearing room to conduct the appeal. The ground was not pleaded; the Appellant was prejudiced by this, and could not be expected to deal with the point “on the hoof”; the point was not open to the Secretary of State to advance on appeal. The essence of Miss Isherwood’s remaining case before us was that although Judge Griffith had identified the correct factors to weigh in the decision, the conclusion reached was wrong in law: this was a case where the public interest plainly outweighed the Appellant’s article 8 right to private life; this appeal should be allowed with the consequence that the Appellant should be deported to Bangladesh. Mr Gill resisted that submission on the basis that Judge Griffith had come to a permissible conclusion on the evidence. There was no irrationality in Judge Griffith’s decision in relation to limb 3, for which adequate reasons had been given (at [74]-[75]). Once the three limbs of exception 1 were satisfied, the conclusion necessarily followed that the Appellant should not be deported, there was no further or additional public interest consideration at that stage. Judge Griffith had plainly considered the case with some care; the determination should stand. The Upper Tribunal should not interfere. Conclusion As we indicated at the hearing, we dismiss this appeal. Dealing first with Mr Gill’s argument on the consequences of an appellant’s satisfying Exception 1, there is no need to look further than paragraph 36 of NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA 662: “In the case of a medium offender, first see whether he falls within Exception 1 or Exception 2. If he does, then the Article 8 claim succeeds.” Here the only basis on which the original grounds challenged Judge Griffith’s conclusion on the applicability of Exception 1 referred to condition (c), the ‘very serious obstacles’ test. Judge Griffith was entitled to conclude that there were, on the evidence, “very significant obstacles” to the Appellant’s integration if he was returned to Bangladesh and accordingly that the requirements of condition (c) of Exception 1 (and para 399A of the Rules) were met. This was essentially a question for her on the facts, on which her conclusion was rational and adequately reasoned. Judge Griffith was well aware of the public interest in deporting foreign criminals and weighed that interest against the Appellant’s right to private life: the approach was sound. There is no basis for us to interfere with Judge Griffith’s conclusion.

10,HU/07061/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: HU/07061/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 17 May 2019 On 03 June 2019      Before DR H H STOREY JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL Between ABUL [H] (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE) Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr D Shrestha of Counsel, instructed by Law Lane Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS 1. In a decision sent to the parties on 1 March 2019, I set aside for material error of law the decision of Judge Watson of the First-tier Tribunal dated 10 December 2018, dismissing the appeal of the appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, against a decision made by the respondent on 9 March 2018 refusing his application for leave to remain on family and private life grounds. I found that the judge erred in failing to address paragraph EX.1(a) of the Immigration Rules (the issue of whether it was reasonable to expect the British citizen child to leave the UK) and also s.117B(6) NIAA 2002. At para 8, I noted that there was no real dispute about the facts, hence the case would be retained in the Upper Tribunal. I then stated at para 9 that: “Neither party referred to the Supreme Court guidance given in KO (Nigeria) UKSC [2018] although in my view its terms lend more support to the appellant than to the respondent. A presidential panel of the Upper Tribunal is due to deliver a decision on several test cases seeking to clarify the guidance given in KO (Nigeria). In view of the necessity for the Upper Tribunal to receive submissions in any event on the significance for the appellant’s case of the guidance given in KO (Nigeria), I shall direct that the case be set down for a further one hour hearing to receive submissions from both parties as to how the decision in this case should be re-made in the light of the guidance given by the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) together with the further analysis of that guidance due to be promulgated by the Upper Tribunal in the aforementioned test cases.” 2. Since then we have had further guidance from the Upper Tribunal, inter alia, in JG (s117B(6): “reasonable le to leave” UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC) Rev 1 and from the Court of Appeal in SSHD v AB (Jamaica) & Anor [2019] EWCA Civ 661. 3. My task in this case is to re-make the decision on the appellant’s appeal. The facts 4. Whilst I stated in my error of law decision that there was no real dispute as to the facts, it is more correct to say that I was satisfied I could proceed on the basis that the judge’s findings of fact were sound. On most matters those findings were based on agreed facts. In particular the following facts are not in dispute. The appellant came to the UK in 2010 as a student and his Tier 4 visa was renewed to 15 September 2015. On 15 September 2015 he applied for leave to remain outside of the Rules and then this was varied on 24 February 2016 to an application for leave to remain under Family and Private Life. This was refused on 17 August 2017 although the refusal notice was not served on the appellant until 14 November 2017. In August 2017 the appellant married Ms [A], this being a marriage arranged by her parents. Both are fit and well. She is a dentist. She completed the undergraduate part of her training in December 2017 and is now doing her post graduate studies and training to complete her qualification. She commenced her one-year placement in March 2018 and worked until May 2018 when she left due to her pregnancy. She returned to work in November 2018. She is earning while training and studying and earns sufficient to support the family. The couple have a baby born in May 2018. Both the baby and Ms [A] are British citizens. Ms [A] was born in the UK and all her family are here. They live with her mother and brother. 5. The only area of factual dispute concerned whether or not the appellant’s wife could get family help with looking after her child. The appellant’s evidence was that his mother and brother had some health problems and would not be able to care for the baby while Ms [A] went to work four days a week and studied one day a week at college and continued her home studies at the weekend. The judge, however, found that there was “considerable family assistance available to Ms [A] in caring for the baby at home and she would also have the ability to look at paid child care assistance” (para 13) - although the judge also accepted at para 16 that “the appellant is at present an important resource to her and her life will be considerably harder if he has to leave the country and make an application to return.” (the judge went on to evaluate that this would not be “unduly harsh”). 6. As regards the appellant’s financial circumstances, the judge also found that the appellant’s wife earned £1700 net per month (in March 2018) and the appellant had thus shown that he and his wife earned sufficient to support the family without recourse to public funds. At para 19 the judge added that “whilst I have found that the spouse has at present sufficient to maintain the family it does not follow that an entry clearance application is bound to succeed. I have very limited documentation before me and the case is not analogous to Chiwamba [2008] UKHL 40. 7. In my error of law decision I found no error in the judge’s finding that the the couple would not face insurmountable obstacles if they had to return to Bangladesh and the appellant had not established that there would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration into Bangladesh society. 8. One feature of the appellant’s case is that at the date of the respondent’s decision, the couple were only expecting a child. It was only by the time of the hearing before the First tier Tribunal judge that the appellant’s wife had given birth to their child. No point was taken by the respondent at the time that this was in fact a “new matter” and one on which pursuant to s.85(5) of the 2002 Act the respondent had not given any consent to it being raised in the appeal. The parties and the judge simply proceeded on the basis that this was evidence that should be considered. However, Mr Kotas confirmed that the respondent was content to proceed on the basis that the appellant’s up to date circumstances, including the fact that there is a British citizen child, should be considered. Submissions 9. I heard submissions from both representatives. Mr Kotas submitted that the further guidance in JG and SSHD v AB(Jamaica) confirmed that the assessment of reasonableness within para.EX.1(a) of the Rules and s 117B(6) NIAA 2002 had to be child-centred and that the Tribunal had to assess reasonableness without considering the conduct of the parent although it was indirectly relevant to consider in the real world what the immigration situation of the parents was. Here the appellant had been in the UK with leave for five years (until September 2015) although not thereafter. Given the very young age of the child, there were no issues concerning education. However, he would accept that the respondent’s current guidance on the position of parents of “qualifying children” treated the fact that there was a qualifying child as a “starting point”. Pages 68-69 of the guidance dated 11 April 2019 stated that “[t]he starting point is that we would not normally expect a qualifying child to leave the UK. It is normally in a child’s best interests for the whole family to remain together, which means if the child is not expected to leave, then the parent or parents or primary carer of the child will also not be expected to leave the UK”. So far as concerns the policy that was in force when the respondent made her decision in this case (Mach 2018), the policy was, he said, as set out in KO (Nigeria). Mr Kotas said that in this case there was no evidence either way about whether the appellant’s wife would leave the UK if the appellant was required to leave. Thus it was a “choice” case. 10. Mr Shrestha submitted that the mother and child were British citizens and that the appellant had had leave (including s.3C leave) lawfully for over 9 years. In these circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK, particularly since it was an accepted fact in this case that the appellant had been playing the major role in looking after the child, as his wife was either working or studying towards her dentistry degree. The appellant is not an overstayer and following the guidance given by the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58, it was important to consider that there were degrees of precariousness and in this case the appellant’s immigration status was not characterised by unlawfulness. He was one year away from being eligible to apply on the basis of 10 years residence. In response to Mr Kotas’ submissions that there was no evidence that the wife would or would not leave the UK and thus that it was a “choice” case, he said that there was evidence as set out in the wife’s witness statement that she would not be able to leave and in any event, under para EX.1(a) of the Rules and s 117B(6) of the 2002 Act it was not the reasonableness of the parent leaving but that of the child that was in issue. He also contended that the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the guidance given in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 as his was a family case and it was clear that the sponsor met the financial requirements given her income and thus entry clearance was “likely to be granted”. 11. In the course of submissions it became clear that more information was needed regarding the wife’s dentistry course and when it was likely to be completed. I gave an oral direction that the appellant’s representatives send within 7 days documentation confirming the wife’s expected degree completion date, with a copy to be sent to the respondent (Mr Kotas indicated the respondent would not wish to respond). In response I received further documents from the appellant’s solicitors, including a witness statement from his wife dated 21 May 2019, which they had sent on 22 May 2019. Policy considerations 12. The Home Office amended its policy document ‘Appendix FM 1.0b: family life (as a partner or parent) and private life: 10 year’, publishing a new version on 19th December 2018. The updated guidance includes a revision to the section entitled ‘Would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?’ (pages 68-70). This was amended following the decision of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria). In its latest incarnation, dated April 2019, the policy document contains the following passages: “Is the child a British citizen or have they lived in the UK for a continuous period of at least 7 years? The decision maker should establish from the application or claim the age and nationality of each child affected by the decision. Where the child is a foreign national, the decision maker should establish their immigration history in the UK (for example how long have they lived in the UK and where they lived before). In establishing whether a non-British Citizen child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of application, the decision maker should include time spent in the UK with and without valid leave. Short periods outside the UK – for example for holidays or family visits – would not count as a break in the continuous period of at least 7 years required. However, where a child has spent more than 6 months out of the UK at any one time, this will normally count as a break in continuous residence unless any exceptional factors apply. Will the consequence of refusal of the application be that the child is required to leave the UK? The decision maker must consider whether the effect of refusal of the application would be, or would be likely to be, that the child would have to leave the UK. This will not be the case where, in practice, the child will, or is likely to, continue to live in the UK with another parent or primary carer. This will be likely to be the case where for example: the child does not live with the applicant the child’s parents are not living together on a permanent basis because the applicant parent has work or other commitments which require them to live apart from their partner and child the child’s other parent lives in the UK and the applicant parent has been here as a visitor and therefore undertook to leave the UK at the end of their visit as a condition of their visit visa or leave to enter If the departure of the parent or carer would not result in the child being required to leave the UK, because the child will (or is likely to) remain living here with another parent or primary carer, then the question of whether it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK will not arise. In these circumstances, paragraph EX.1.(a) does not apply. However, where there is a genuine and subsisting parental relationship between the applicant and the child, the removal of the applicant may still disrupt their relationship with that child. For that reason, the decision maker will still need to consider whether, in the round, removal of the applicant is appropriate in light of all the real-life circumstances of the case, considering the best interests of the child as a primary consideration and the impact on the child of the applicant’s departure from the UK, or them having to leave the UK with them. If it is considered that refusal would lead to unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, the child or their family, leave will fall to be granted on the basis of exceptional circumstances. Would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK? If the effect of refusal of the application would be, or is likely to be, that the child would have to leave the UK, the decision maker must consider whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. Where there is a qualifying child A child is a qualifying child if they are a British child who has an automatic right of abode in the UK, to live here without any immigration restrictions as a result of their citizenship, or a non-British citizen child, who has lived in the UK for a continuous period of at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of application, which recognises that over time children start to put down roots and to integrate into life in the UK. The starting point is that we would not normally expect a qualifying child to leave the UK. It is normally in a child’s best interest for the whole family to remain together, which means if the child is not expected to leave, then the parent or parents or primary carer of the child will also not be expected to leave the UK. In the caselaw of KO and Others 2018 UKSC53, with particular reference to the case of NS (Sri Lanka), the Supreme Court found that “reasonableness” is to be considered in the real-world context in which the child finds themselves. The parents’ immigration status is a relevant fact to establish that context. The determination sets out that if a child’s parents are both expected to leave the UK, the child is normally expected to leave with them, unless there is evidence that that it would not be reasonable. There may be some specific circumstances where it would be reasonable to either expect the qualifying child to leave the UK with the parent(s) or primary carer or for the parent(s) or primary carer to leave the UK and for the child to stay. In deciding such cases, the decision maker must consider the best interests of the child and the facts relating to the family as a whole. The decision maker should also consider any specific issues raised by the family or by, or on behalf of the child (or other children in the family). It may be reasonable for a qualifying child to leave the UK with the parent or primary carer where for example: the parent or parents, or child, are a citizen of the country and so able to enjoy the full rights of being a citizen in that country there is nothing in any country specific information, including as contained in relevant country information which suggests that relocation would be unreasonable the parent or parents or child have existing family, social, or cultural ties with the country and if there are wider family or relationships with friends or community overseas that can provide support: o the decision maker must consider the extent to which the child is dependent on or requires support from wider family members in the UK in important areas of his or her life and how a transition to similar support overseas would affect them o a person who has extended family or a network of friends in the country should be able to rely on them for support to help (re)integrate there o parent or parents or a child who have lived in or visited the country before for periods of more than a few weeks. should be better able to adapt, or the parent or parents would be able to support the child in adapting, to life in the country o the decision maker must consider any evidence of exposure to, and the level of understanding of, the cultural norms of the country o for example, a period of time spent living amongst a diaspora from the country may give a child an awareness of the culture of the country o the parents or child can speak, read and write in a language of that country, or are likely to achieve this within a reasonable time period o fluency is not required – an ability to communicate competently with sympathetic interlocutors would normally suffice • removal would not give rise to a significant risk to the child’s health • there are no other specific factors raised by or on behalf of the child For guidance on how to consider a child’s best interests, see the Exceptional Circumstances section of the Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0a Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) 5-Year Routes and exceptional circumstances guidance, which can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chapter-8-appendix-fm-family-members Where the decision maker believes that, based on the specific circumstances raised, refusal would not breach their Article 8 rights, they should refer to the following section on compassionate compelling factors, to consider whether a short period of leave outside the Immigration Rules is appropriate: compassionate factors.” 13. I would make several observations about this policy document. The first is that it (still) does not accurately reflect the decision in KO (Nigeria) , in that it states that “[i]f If the departure of the parent or carer would not result in the child being required to leave the UK, because the child will (or is likely to) remain living here with another parent or primary carer, then the question of whether it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK will not arise. In these circumstances, paragraph EX.1.(a) does not apply.” As confirmed by the Upper Tribunal in JG and the Court of Appeal in SSHD v AB (Jamaica), the decision-maker when assessing reasonableness has to hypothesise whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave, even if it is considered unlikely the child will. As noted by UTJ Plimmer in SR (subsisting parental relationship - s117B(6)) Pakistan [2018] UKUT 334 (IAC) and as endorsed by the President in JG at paras 33-59 policy documents in the present form do not provide a tenable construction of the plain and ordinary meaning of EX.1(a) or of s.117B(6). 14. Second, there is no longer any specific mention in the policy doucments of the fact that it is not reasonable to expect a British citizen child to leave the UK. That omission, however, does not alter the fact that a British citizen child is entitled to live and reside in the UK and cannot be required to leave. Both a British citizen child and a child residing for 7 years may be a “qualifying child” and no subdivision is made between the two categories; but that does not entail that no greater weight attaches to the fact of nationality than to the fact of 7 years residence. As noted by Baroness Hale at [30], “[a]though nationality is not a ""trump card"" it is of particular importance in assessing the best interests of any child” and at [32] it was stated: “32. Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be played down. As citizens these children have rights which they will not be able to exercise if they move to another country. They will lose the advantages of growing up and being educated in their own country, their own culture and their own language. They will have lost all this when they come back as adults. As Jacqueline Bhaba (in 'The ""Mere Fortuity of Birth""? Children, Mothers, Borders and the Meaning of Citizenship', in Migrations and Mobilities: Citizenship, Borders and Gender (2009), edited by Seyla Benhabib and Judith Resnik, at p 193) has put it: 'In short, the fact of belonging to a country fundamentally affects the manner of exercise of a child's family and private life, during childhood and well beyond. Yet children, particularly young children, are often considered parcels that are easily movable across borders with their parents and without particular cost to the children.' “ British citizenship creates rights and benefits that exist from the moment when it is acquired and constitutes a status that places a person outside immigration controls. (I shall return to the significance I attach to the fact that the child is a British citizen later on when assessing reasonableness.) 15. These two features reduce somewhat the value of this guidance insofar as it is intended to reflect case law. 16. Third, it would appear on the basis of developments in Home Office policy guidance that it is no longer possible to say straightforwardly, as the Tribunal did in SF & Others [2017] UKUT 120 (IAC), that since the respondent’s policy accepts that (absent criminality or a poor immigration history) the British citizen children should not be expected to leave the UK, there can be no public interest in requiring their parent(s) to leave. The policy document at the time of the decision of concern in SF & Others was Immigration Directorate Instruction - Family Migration - Appendix FM, Section 1.0(B) ""Family Life as a Partner or Parent and Private Life, 10-year Routes"" (the edition of August 2015). At 11.2.3 it contained a section headed “Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen Child to leave the UK?”. The Tribunal in SF & Others set out its relevant parts as follows: ""Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must not take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer of a British Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age of that child. This reflects the European Court of Justice Judgment in Zambrano. Where a decision to refuse the application would require a parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the case must always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU with that parent or primary carer. In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship. It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where the conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations of such weight as to justify separation, if the child could otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in the UK or in the EU. The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others: criminality falling below the thresholds set out in paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules; a very poor immigration history, such as where the person has repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules.” 17.This led the Upper Tribunal to conclude at para 12 that: “…where there is clear guidance which covers a case where an assessment has to be made, and where the guidance clearly demonstrates what the outcome of the assessment would have been made by the Secretary of State, it would, we think, be the normal practice for the Tribunal to take such guidance into account and to apply it in assessing the same consideration in a case that came before it.” 18. At the same time, despite being now silent on the specific position of the parent of a British citizen child, the latest policy document does accept that “[t]he starting point is that we would not normally expect a qualifying child to leave the UK” and that “[i]t is normally in a child’s best interests for the whole family to remain together, which means if the child is not expected to leave, then the parent or parents or primary carer of the child will also not be expected to leave the UK”. That wording indicates a presumption in favour of the parent of a British citizen child (or non-British citizen child resident for 7 years) not being expected to leave the UK unless there are specific circumstances that would make that proportionate. To that extent, the new policy document continues to have a bearing on the proper assessment of the weight to be attached to the public interest in requiring a parent of a British citizen child to leave. If that presumption is not displaced on the facts of a particular case, it amounts to the respondent saying there is no public interest in requiring such a parent to leave. My assessment 19. In the appellant’s case, six factors seem to me to be of particular importance. 20. First, there is the fact that the child is a British citizen. That seems to me to be of particular importance in this case because, being still very young, most of the considerations that arise in the case of non-British citizen children resident in the UK for 7 years, such as their educational, linguistic, cultural circumstances in the UK, cannot play a significant role. Many of the rights and benefits that accrue from British nationality are for a very young child still putative. Yet they are important in the present because they are rights which, if required to live in Bangladesh, the child would not be able to exercise in the future. In particular, as noted by Baroness Hale in ZH (Tanzania), the child will lose the advantages of growing up and being educated in their own country. 21. Secondly, whilst there is incomplete information about the appellant’s financial circumstances, Mr Kotas has not disputed that the appellant would be able, on the basis of the wife’s present income levels, to meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules governing spouses. Nor has Mr Kotas suggested that there are any other possible respects in which the appellant might face difficulties in meeting in full the requirements for entry clearance as a spouse. That in my view does bring into play the principles set out in Chikwamba, at least to the extent that it appears likely the appellant would succeed in any such application. Mr Kotas’s submissions that Chikwamba principles only apply if the appellant is “bound’” to succeed in an entry clearance application is too narrow a reading. As was stated by the President in JG at para 85: “85. In so concluding, we apply the law as set out by the House of Lords in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 and in subsequent cases, including Hayat v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1054. Following the approach adopted by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill in R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality) (IJR) [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC), we acknowledge that where an application for entry clearance from abroad is likely to be granted and where there would be significant interference with family life by temporary removal of the person making that application, then the weight to be accorded to the requirements of obtaining entry clearance (that is to say, to that aspect of immigration control) is to be reduced, particularly in cases involving children.” (emphasis added) 22. Thirdly, the appellant has been playing a major role as a parent of the couple’s child since the child’s birth and, if not required to leave, that is likely to continue to be the case, at least until his wife has completed her postgraduate dentistry qualifications. In the absence of the appellant, the child would have extremely limited care from the appellant’s wife because of her combination of work and studies. 23. Fourthly, on the hypothesis of the child being required to leave the UK, that would most likely to result in a situation where his mother, a British citizen, remains in the UK to complete her dentistry qualifications. I make that finding of fact because I see no reason not to accept what she said regarding this in her witness statement of 20 July 2018 wherein she stated that “I am in the middle of my degree and cannot be expected to leave my education in the UK where I want to develop a career in dentistry. The further documentation sent by the appellant on 22 May 2019 identifies that her initial completion date for her Dental Foundation Training was 31 August 2019 but that this was extended for 12 months due to maternity leave, lack of completion of requirements and LTFT (Less Than Full Time Training), so that her extended course completion date at Birmingham University is 31 August 2020. Her further witness statement notes that she has spent 7 academic years studying A levels and a degree in Dentistry and that her departure “would completely end my education and in the UK and my future employment prospects”. Her plain intention to complete her course in the UK makes very good sense in terms of planning the economic future of her family, whether that be in the UK or Bangladesh, since without completing this qualification, she would not be able to practice as a dentist. Given that on my finding the appellant’s wife would remain in the UK, at least until completion of her course, I consider the appellant’s departure would cause significant disruption to the child, whose best interests surely lie in remaining with both parents. I consider that would be the case even in the context of a temporary separation (necessary to make an application for entry clearance), since even on that basis it would involve significant interference with family life, taking into account the best interests of the child. 24. Fifthly, the appellant has not had any period of time in the UK during which his stay has been unlawful. He had lawful leave as a student until September 2015 and has since then enjoyed s.3C leave. Whilst for s.117B(5) purposes his immigration status has nevertheless been precarious throughout, his situation is to be clearly contrasted with an appellant who over the same period has been in the UK illegally or unlawfully. In contrast to the position of the appellant in JG (who was found to be both dishonest and unscrupulous and to have flagrantly defied the law by overstaying her leave for a large number of years (see para 80)), it would be disproportionate to require this appellant to return to Bangladesh to make an entry clearance application from there. 25. Sixthly, I consider that the revised version of the Home Office policy governing the position of qualifying children in relation to the reasonableness criterion indicates that there is a presumption in favour of the parent of a qualifying child not being required to leave. In my judgement, the aforementioned factors suffice to establish that the presumption has not been rebutted in the appellant’s case. 26. I consider these reasons suffice to establish that the appellant in this case is entitled to succeed under para EX.1(a) of the Immigration Rules and also under s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act. He is the parent of a child whom it would not be reasonable to expect to leave the UK. 27. To conclude: I have already set aside the decision of the FtT judge for material error of law. The decision I re-make is to allow the appellant’s appeal. No anonymity direction is made. Signed Date: 28 May 2019 ",2019-06-03
11,HU/06168/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: HU/06168/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 9 May 2019 On 3 June 2019      Before UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GRUBB Between THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Appellant and ATIQUR [R] Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer For the Respondent: Mr B Malik instructed by UK Migration Lawyers Ltd DECISION AND REASONS Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I will refer to the parties as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal. Background The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 27 November 1981. He first entered the United Kingdom on 21 September 2006 with entry clearance as a student and leave valid until 31 October 2009. Thereafter, his leave was extended on a number of occasions as a Tier 1 (Post Study) Student and as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 5 September 2016. On 2 September 2016, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) relying on para 276B of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) on the grounds of ten years continuous lawful residence in the UK. On 5 February 2018, the Secretary of State refused the appellant’s claim under para 276B and also under Art 8 ECHR on the basis of his private and family life under Appendix FM and outside the Rules. The sole basis for the Secretary of State’s decision in respect of para 276B was that the ‘general ground’ of refusal in para 322(5) of the Immigration Rules applied, namely that it was undesirable to permit him to continue to remain the UK in the light of his conduct. The basis of that decision was that there were discrepancies in the appellant’s claimed income for the tax years 2010/11 and 2012/13 relied upon in his earlier applications for leave and in his disclosed income to the HMRC for those tax years. In relation to his early applications for leave, the Appellant had claimed to have a self-employed income for the tax year 2010/2011 of £37,032 whilst his self-employed income submitted to HMRC for that year was £5,715 – a discrepancy of over £31,000. In relation to the tax year 2012/2013, the self-employed income claimed in his earlier application for leave was £39,171. The figure disclosed to the HMRC for the purposes of his tax liability in that year was £8,742. That was a discrepancy of over £30,000. The appellant had in 2016 sought to rectify the discrepancies with the HMRC and on 26 May 2016 a further assessment was made for the tax year 2012/2013 requesting him to pay tax of £8,123.19. Further, on 17 August 2016, and in respect of his tax liability for the year 2010/2011, a further assessment asking him to pay £9,147.97 was issued by the HMRC. The Secretary of State was satisfied that the appellant had misrepresented his earnings and concluded that the discretionary ‘general ground’ of refusal under para 322(5) applied. That was the sole basis upon which leave was refused under para 276B on the basis of the appellant’s ten years continuous lawful residence in the UK. The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The appellant submitted a bundle of documents including a detailed witness statement at pages D1-10 of the bundle. The appellant also gave oral evidence and was cross-examined by a Presenting Officer. The essence of the appellant’s case was that he had not been dishonest. He had had two sources of income, namely from his business services and travel services. The income from the former exceeded the latter. He claimed that he had employed two separate firms of accountants to deal with his two sets of business affairs. He did so on the basis that he believed that two separate tax returns had to be submitted. His evidence was that both accountants used the “same Login details for the HMRC portal” which allowed for the provisional details of his self-assessment. The firm of accountants dealing with his business services (J Stanley Riz & Company) provided details of his business services income on the online portal. However, the firm of accountants dealing with his travel services (Mahmood Accountancy) changed the figures to reflect the income derived from his travel services. As a result, only the income from his travel services was declared to the HMRC. He said that it was the income from his business services which was declared to the Secretary of State and hence the discrepancy. The appellant’s case was that he was unaware of the discrepancy until in late 2015, in the course of child proceedings concerned with his now former partner, it was pointed out by her that he had declared the incorrect income. There had been a delay in doing so but that had occurred in 2016. Before the judge, the appellant’s evidence was that he had attempted to obtain supporting documents from his accountants, but the firm of J Stanley Riz & Company (who dealt with his business services income) had closed down and Mahmood Accountancy (who had dealt with his travel services income) had refused to assist him. He said that he had sent texts to the office but had had “no success”. He claimed before the judge that he was not (as required for para 322(5) to apply) dishonest: the discrepancy was simply a mistake which he had corrected. Judge Young-Harry gave her reasons for concluding that the respondent had not established that para 322(5) applied, in particular that the appellant had been dishonest, at paras 16-22 as follows: “16. The appellant claimed, as part of his November 2011 Tier 1 extension application, that he earned £37,032 for the period 2010-2011. The respondent does not challenge this, neither does he suggest that this figure is incorrect. However the appellant declared a substantially lower figure in his HMRC tax return for the same period. 17. As part of his April 2013 Tier 1 application, the appellant declared an income of £39,171 however he again declared a much lower figure on his tax return. The respondent does not dispute the income as declared in the April 2013 Tier 1 application. 18. The appellant claims he did not notice the discrepancy until his wife pointed it out recently. He immediately took steps to remedy the issue with HMRC. 19. The appellant claims the problem arose because he has two income streams, one from business services and the other from travel services. The appellant for some reason thought it would be expedient to have two separate accountants, who in turn thought it would be a good idea to submit two separate tax returns for the same year. This understandably caused great confusion and is the reason for the discrepancy. 20. The appellant made an unprompted declaration to HMRC, asking them to rectify the figures. The fact it was unprompted, meant the appellant avoided a penalty and no further action was taken. I find this is to the appellant’s credit. I note by notifying HMRC, the appellant would be required to pay more tax; despite this he still made the decision to notified them. 21. I found the appellant’s explanation credible and reliable. Although, given the nature of his business one would have expected a higher degree of vigilance, however I accept it was a mistake and it was not directly attributable to the appellant. 22. I do not find the respondent’s case is made out in this regard. I do not find paragraph 322(5) has been correctly applied ....” The judge went on to find that the remaining requirements of para 276B were met – indeed the contrary was not, it seems, argued before her – and in the light of that allowed the appellant’s appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR. The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal essentially on two grounds. First, the judge in reaching her finding that the appellant had not been dishonest had failed to apply the approach set out in the Upper Tribunal’s decision in R (Khan) v SSHD (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC), in particular in considering all the relevant evidence as set out in para (v) of the headnote. Secondly, the judge had been wrong to take into account (at para 20), that the appellant had made an “unprompted declaration to the HMRC” in 2016 rectifying the under-disclosed income and, therefore, liability to tax in the years 2010/11 and 2013/14. On 28 January 2019, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge N Haria) granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal. On 14 April 2019, the appellant filed a rule 24 response seeking to uphold the judge’s decision. Discussion The relevant provision in para 322(5) of the Immigration Rules, which is central to this appeal, sets out a ‘general ground’ of refusal on a discretionary basis in the following terms: “The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including convictions which do not fall within para 322(1C)), character or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national security.” The proper interpretation and application of that provision has recently been examined by the Court of Appeal in the case of R (Balajigari and Others) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673. That case, concerned with a number of judicial review decisions challenges refusals of leave based upon para 322(5), recognises a two-stage approach: an assessment of whether the individual’s conduct makes a grant of leave “undesirable”; and if it is, whether discretion should be exercised to refuse leave. The analysis in relation to the first issue is at [33]-[38]and in relation to the second issue is at [39]-[44]. As regards the issue of “undesirability”, the Court of Appeal accepted the submissions made on behalf of the individuals in that case that there were three limbs relevant to determining that issue. The court said this at [34]: “There must be: (i) reliable evidence of; (ii) sufficiently reprehensible conduct; and (iii) an assessment, taking proper account of all relevant circumstances known about the applicant at the date of decision, of whether his or his presence in the UK is undesirable (this should include evidence of positive features of their conduct).” It was common ground between the representatives before me that the Court of Appeal’s decision in Balajigari did not materially affect the issues that I had to decide. That was because the judge’s decision turns upon whether the appellant had been shown to be dishonest. The Court of Appeal had accepted that dishonesty was a “touch-stone” of establishing this ground (see [36]). Consequently, if the judge’s decision was legally sound, the appellant succeeded. However, if it was not legally sound and the decision was set aside, then any remaking of the decision would have to take into account the approach in Balajigari in reaching a fresh decision as to whether para 322(5) applied. Consequently, the submissions before me focused on whether the judge had erred in law by failing to apply the approach set out in the UT’s decision in Khan. Before I turn to that decision, Khan was considered by the Court of Appeal in Balajigari (see especially [40]-[44]). The UT’s decision was, in general, approved by the Court of Appeal with the caveat that at [32] the UT in Khan had mis-stated – by putting the matter too high – when concluding that the Secretary of State was entitled as a “starting point” to infer that an individual had been deceitful or dishonest when a significant difference in disclosed income was discovered. At [42], the Court of Appeal considered that there might be a “danger” in this approach; the correct approach was that the discrepancy might raise a “suspicion” but did not in itself justify the conclusion that the individual was dishonest. The discrepancy called for an explanation and, if an explanation when sought is not forthcoming or is unconvincing, it may be legitimate for the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty. The Secretary of State must: “simply decide, considering the discrepancy in the light of the explanation (or lack of it), whether he is satisfied that the applicant has been dishonest.” Consequently, since the judge found that the appellant was dishonest, the only issue in the appeal before me is whether the judge was lawfully entitled to reach that conclusion. If she was, that is the end of the matter and the appellant has succeeded. However, if she made a material error in reaching that finding, then the decision in respect of para 322(5) must be remade now in the light of the approach set out in Balajigari. Mr Howells, on behalf of the Secretary of State relied principally on headnote (v) in Khan. That provides as follows: “(v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest or merely careless the Secretary of State should consider the following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted): i. Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is plausible; ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed to exist (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his accountant at the time of the tax return) has been disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing; iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been made because his liability to pay tax was less than he should have expected; iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and the explanation for any significant delay.” Mr Howells submitted that the judge had failed to take into account, in her reasoning at paras 16-22, that there was no supporting documentation from the appellant’s accountants to support his claimed mistake on their part. Mr Howells submitted that, although the appellant said when one firm closed down and the other had refused to co-operate, he had referred to texts but these had not been produced either. Likewise, there was no evidence from his estranged wife to support his claim that she had alerted him to the discrepancy during their child maintenance proceedings in 2015. Mr Howells accepted that the headnote in Khan addressed the approach that should be taken by the Secretary of State but it ought also to apply to how a judge in the First-tier Tribunal should assess an individual’s explanation as to why was not dishonest. Mr Howells did not seek to rely upon the second part of the ground, namely that the judge had been wrong to take into account that HMRC had not imposed a penalty upon him when he submitted his revised income in 2016. Perhaps straying somewhat from that ground, Mr Howells, instead, submitted that what the judge had failed to do was consider the timing of the appellant’s further disclosure to the HMRC which resulted in reassessment in August 2016, shortly before the appellant applied for ILR on 2 September 2016. Mr Malik, who represented the appellant relied upon his rule 24 response. He pointed out that Khan was a judicial review decision giving guidance to the Secretary of State in the context of a decision taken without an oral hearing such as had occurred in this appeal. The judge, unlike the Secretary of State, could take into account the oral evidence and demeanour of the appellant (or any other witnesses) who gave evidence. The judge was entitled to make a holistic assessment and she had done so. He submitted that the decision in Khan did not lay rigid guidelines. At para 21 the judge had stated that she found “the appellant’s explanation credible and reliable”. Mr Malik submitted that this was tantamount to a finding that the appellant was credible. As regards Mr Howells’ second point, Mr Malik submitted that this was not directly raised in the grounds. The judge had not wrongly taken into account that the HMRC had not imposed a penalty upon the appellant. Rather, the judge had noted that the appellant had made an “unprompted declaration” to HMRC. Mr Malik submitted that consistently with what was said in Khan at [37(vi)(iv)] the judge was entitled to take into account: “Whether, at any stage, the applicant has taken steps to remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and the explanation for any significant delay.” (my emphasis). Mr Malik submitted that the Secretary of State’s challenge did not establish perversity on behalf of the judge even if the decision might be considered to be generous. I accept Mr Malik’s submission that the approach set out by the UT in Khan, in particular at headnote (v), is not, nor was it intended to be, prescriptive. It sets out common sense guidance as to the factors which a decision maker would likely take into account in assessing whether an individual was dishonest in his dealings with the respondent and HMRC. I do not, however, accept Mr Malik’s submission that that approach is wholly irrelevant in the context of an appeal hearing in which the individual (and indeed others) may give oral evidence. What was said was, of course, in the context of the Secretary of State’s decision making which may not involve any face-to-face contact with the individual, although that is likely to become less so as a result of the Court of Appeal’s decision in Balajigari about the requirements of fairness in cases of this sort. The matter referred to in headnote (v) of Khan remain, in my judgment, equally relevant in the context of an appeal hearing. There, of course, the judge may well have the benefit of oral evidence, and in particular from the appellant giving his explanation and which can be subject to cross-examination. The rigours of that process may well form a significant part of the judge’s assessment of the appellant’s veracity in respect of his claimed lack of dishonesty. It does not, however, exclude the relevance of the absence of, for example, supporting documentation from accountants or others and the behaviour of the individual in respect of correcting discrepancies in particular the timing of any corrective action. Although it is not directly quoted in headnote (v), para [37(v)] of the UT judgment encapsulates the approach as follows: “Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a tax return has been dishonest or merely careless, the Secretary of State is obliged to consider the evidence pointing in each direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the reasoning is rational and the evidence has been properly considered, the decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.” In my judgment, the words “Secretary of State” can be substituted by “the Tribunal” and the proposition is equally correct. In my judgment, the judge did fall into error in this appeal. I do not accept Mr Malik’s submission that the judge reached her decision, at least visibly so, on the basis of accepting the credibility and veracity of the appellant during the course of his oral evidence. The judge does not directly quote any of the evidence whether in-chief or by way of cross-examination given by the appellant. All that she says at para 21 is that she found “the appellant’s explanation credible and reliable”. I do not consider that the judge’s reasoning and finding in paras 16-22 obviously turned upon an assessment of the appellant and his oral evidence. Had it done so, that might have been sufficient – at least on a perversity challenge – to sustain her reasoning and finding. I accept Mr Howells’ submission that the judge failed properly to take into account all the relevant matters in assessing the appellant’s veracity and whether the Secretary of State had established that he was dishonest. There is no reference to the absence of any supporting evidence from the appellant’s two firms of accountants. Even if it could be said that the appellant’s evidence would be that he could obtain nothing from them as one had gone out of business and the other had refused to co-operate, there were still the claimed texts in which he had at least sought supporting evidence from his accountants. That evidence was not produced and the judge did not consider its absence in assessing whether the appellant’s innocent explanation stood up. There was also no supporting evidence from his estranged wife whom he claimed had alerted him to the discrepancy in the disclosure of his income to the HMRC. Further, Mr Howells was, in my judgment, right not to pursue an argument that the judge had wrongly taken into account in para 20 that the HMRC had not imposed a penalty. I accept Mr Malik’s submission on this issue but that is not what the judge did in para 20. What she did there was, however, to take into account that he had made an “unprompted declaration to HMRC”. Mr Howells relied on the fact that the judge, in doing so, had failed to take into account the proximity of that exercise with the HMRC to the appellant’s application for ILR in September 2016. Mr Malik, and indeed so did Mr Howells, accepted, that this point did not directly arise out of the parts of the ground concerned with para 20. However, it does arise, in my judgment, from the general point made in Mr Howells’ principal ground that the judge failed properly to apply the approach in Khan. The need to have regard to the timing of any dealings with HMRC – which could of course ‘cut either way’ in any given case – is specifically referred to by the UT at [37(v)] which I set out above. The judge, in effect, only considered one aspect of the appellant’s “unprompted declaration” – and treated it as being in his favour – in para 20 without also taking into account the timing of those dealings with HMRC. For these reasons, therefore, I am satisfied that the judge failed properly to grapple with all the relevant evidence in reaching her finding that the Secretary of State had not established that the appellant was dishonest and so para 322(5) did not apply. Decision and Disposal The First-tier Tribunal’s decision to allow the appellant’s appeal involved the making of an error of law. The Judge’s decision to allow the appeal under Art 8 cannot stand and is set aside. In these circumstances, both representatives agreed that the proper course was to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in order to remake the Art 8 decision. The judge’s decision and findings in respect of para 322(5) cannot stand. However, it was agreed that the following findings of the judge should stand: in respect of the best interests of the appellant’s child (para 23); that the requirements of para 276ADE are not met (para 24); and that the appellant speaks English and there is no evidence of reliance on public funds (para 26). I also see no reason why the concession, reflected in para 22, that, apart from para 322(5), the appellant meets the requirement of para 276B should not also stand. The appeal is accordingly remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (to a judge other than Judge Young-Harry) to re-make the decision in respect of Art 8.

By a decision which I promulgated on 8 March 2019, I found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that its decision fell to be set aside. My reasons and consequent directions were as follows:""1. The appellant was born in 1987 and is a male citizen of Iraq. By a decision promulgated on 1 August 2018, the First-tier Tribunal determined the appellant's appeal against the refusal of asylum issued by the Secretary of State on 23 May 2018. The appeal was allowed on humanitarian protection grounds but otherwise dismissed. The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal. He argues that the First-tier Tribunal should have allowed his appeal on asylum grounds.2. At the initial hearing at Bradford on 27 February 2019, I found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that its decision fell to be set aside. The appellant claims asylum on the basis that he is an atheist and would campaign as such if returned to Iraq. He is a Kurd who has lived in IKR but both parties acknowledge that he would be removed to Baghdad and, being without a CSID card or the means to obtain a replacement, he would be at risk in Baghdad before he could arrange to exercise internal flight to the IKR. Is unclear from the judge's decision whether she believed that the appellant could relocate to the IKR; she states at [25] that he cannot but elsewhere makes a number of comments regarding the attitudes towards atheism in Kurdistan, including commenting that being an atheist in the IKR may be 'easy.' Moreover, the judge appears to have relied [20] upon a news article referred to in a Country of Origin Information Request (COIR) which suggests that as many as '32%' of the population of Iraq is atheist. It is not clear what weight judge has placed on this surprising statistic. I find that the judge has not properly considered risk to the appellant as a campaigning atheist in Iraq and as an apostate from the religion of Islam. She has not engaged with the reasons why the appellant may refrain from campaigning for atheism in Iraq (see HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31). I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I am grateful to Mr Sills, who appeared for the appellant, for drafting directions in preparation for the resumed hearing which will take place Bradford before me on a date to be fixed. Those directions have now been agreed by both parties and, subject to minor amendments, also by me. I set out the directions below.Notice of Decision The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The Upper Tribunal shall remake the decision following the resumed hearing at Bradford before Upper Tribunal Judge Lane on a date to be fixed (2 hours; Kurdish Sorani interpreter)The following directions shall apply:Matters not in dispute:1. The Appellant is entitled to humanitarian protection on the basis that he is at risk of destitution due to his inability to obtain a CSID card. He is unable safely to enter the IKR. 2. The Appellant is an atheist.3. The Appellant is an openly campaigning atheist in the UK. 4. The Appellant would continue to be an openly campaigning atheist in Iraq5. The only reason the Appellant may not live as an openly campaigning atheist in Iraq would be his fear of persecution. Issues to be determined by the Upper Tribunal at the resumed hearing1. Does the Appellant have a well-founded fear of persecution as an openly campaigning atheist in Iraq?Directions for the resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal 1. The Secretary of State shall notify the Upper Tribunal in writing within 14 days of receiving the error of law decision/directions if he wishes to cross-examine the Appellant. If Secretary of State fails to notify the Upper Tribunal within 14 days, he will not be permitted to cross-examine the Appellant at the resumed hearing.2. Both parties may file at the Upper Tribunal and serve on each other additional evidence going to the issue in dispute no less than 5 days before the resumed hearing. Other Matters3. The Respondent is invited to consider whether to continue to contest Appellant's asylum appeal. If the Respondent decides not to continue to contest the appeal he may seek to agree with the appellant a draft consent order disposing of the proceedings pursuant to paragraph 39, Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.""2. At the resumed hearing, the appellant produced fresh background material in the form of a supplementary bundle. Of particular relevance is a Query Response produced by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and dated 10 April 2018 which considers atheism in Iraq, including Kurdistan. This document records that in Iraq atheism is equated with blasphemy and apostasy. The report records a story in 'Your Middle East' from 2014 of a 16-year-old student from Erbil who was tortured by the police having declared himself an atheist. It is true that the background material does not provide many specific examples such as that but that is, perhaps, not surprising given that a strong theme emerging from the background material is that atheists take rigorous steps to conceal their opinions from the authorities throughout Iraq, including Kurdistan. Al-Monitor is reported as having stated that, 'there are many Iraqi websites and blogs that cater to atheists, but they all keep their membership lists secret for fear of being persecuted and killed by extremist religious militias in groups or even by ordinary citizens in the street.' The threat, therefore, to atheists appears to come from both state and non-state actors. It is also clear that those who are atheists can only live in Iraq safely by concealing their atheist activities and opinions and they do so because openly expressing such views would expose them to a real risk of persecution or Article 3 ECHR ill-treatment. 3. There is a further issue. The appellant does not possess a CSID card. The appellant would, by operation of the Secretary of State's current policy, be returned to Baghdad. The background material indicates that, in addition to the usual problems in obtaining a card which arise in cases involving returnees (see AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944), the US State Department recorded in 2016 that cards would only be issued to those who declared their religion to be Christian, Sabaean-Mandaean, Yezidi and Muslim; there appears to be no provision at all for a card to be issued to a declared atheist.4. Mr Diwnycz, who appeared for the Secretary of State, submitted that the case turned upon whether the appellant is a proselytising atheist. However, that submission appears to ignore paragraph [4] of the agreed directions (see above) and the clear evidence that has been produced which shows that the appellant would be permitted no public expression of his atheist beliefs because of a fear of persecution; any risk would not be confined to the proselytising of atheism. 5. In the light of the agreed facts upon which the resumed hearing has proceeded considering the evidence which was before the First-tier Tribunal together with the new background material produced before the Upper Tribunal, I find that the appellant, a genuinely committed atheist, would, if returned to Iraq, take steps to conceal his atheism solely in order to avoid the risk of suffering persecution at the hands of state actors or Article 3 ECHR ill-treatment at the hands of non-state actors. In addition, it is pointless to speculate whether the appellant could obtain a CSID card; I find that he would be unable to complete the application for such a card without dissembling as to his lack of belief in any of the religions recognised by the Iraqi state. He would, therefore, as a sole male Kurdish returnee in Baghdad be exposed to a real risk of harm because he would not have the required card nor could he obtain one. On the particular facts of this appeal, the appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal to give him international protection is allowed.Notice of DecisionThe appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 28 May 2018 is allowed on asylum grounds and human rights grounds (Article 3 ECHR)Signed Date 28 MAY 2019Upper Tribunal Judge LaneDirection Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellants are granted anonymity.

This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M Davies promulgated on the 8th January 2019 whereby the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse the appellant's claims based on asylum, humanitarian protection or relief otherwise on the grounds of Article 2 and 3 of the ECHR. Article 8 of the ECHR. 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it necessary to do so.3. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro on 5th February 2019. Thus the case appeared before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law in the decision. 4. The material part of the grant of leave provides:-3 The findings of the judge that the appellant was not credible are properly reasoned applying the correct standard of proof. In respect of the judge's findings on risk of return, it is noted that he did not take into account the recent CG case HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT. The appellant is of Kurdish ethnicity and paragraph 76 the judge makes reference to the appellant's ""Facebook posts"" and that it had been put up to bolster his case. However, in HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT the Tribunal said this at paragraph 116:-""We are satisfied that the content the appellant's Facebook page would become known to the authorities on return as part of the process of investigation of his background. That is the effect of the expert background evidence before us. It is then, no step at all to the conclusion that this would involve a real risk of persecution and Article 3 ill-treatment in his case""4 In light of what he said in HB about what can occur at the airport in Iran on return is arguable that the judge in failing to consider this made an error of law. Permission is granted.5. That is the extent of the leave granted in respect of the judgement by Judge Davies.6. Before me the appellant's representative sought to argue that the whole of the decision was flawed. 7. It is to be noted that the appellant has had a previous asylum appeal, Appeal number PA/07462/2016. That asylum appeal was also based on the appellant's claimed conversion to Zoroastrianism and a number of incidents occurring in Iran. That appeal was dismissed on 19 December 2016. Before me the issue of that previous decision was raised and what the impact of the findings in those proceeding was. The representative for the respondent seeking to raise adverse credibility findings as being material, whilst the appellant's representative's claim it was not part of the case that the appellant had fabricated parts of his account. 8. In approaching the previous judgement Judge Davies has properly applied the guidance in the case of Devaseelan 2002 UKIAT 00702. As indicated by Judge O'Garro. Judge Davies has given valid reasons for reaching the conclusion that the appellant is not genuinely a convert to Zoroastrianism. The judge has also given valid reasons for finding that he did not believe the appellant's account that his family had become aware of his involvement in Zoroastrianism by reason of posts on line including his Facebook posts and posts on YouTube. 9. With regard to the submissions by the respondent's representative credibility is to be determined on the basis of the evidence before Judge Davies. Previous findings of fact stand unless the criteria in Devaseelan are met. However the fact that an individual may not have been truthful in the past does not mean that they are not being truthful now. The judge has properly approached the issue of credibility in making findings of fact and properly applied the guidance in the case law. With regard to the assertion by the appellant's representative that it was not suggested that the appellant had fabricated an account, the judge on the previous occasions had given valid reasons for finding the appellant's claims were not true. If the account were not true the appellant must have created the account to substantiate his claim for asylum. 10. In the circumstances Judge Davies was entitled to approach the issues in the case in the manner that he has. The judge has given valid reasons for finding the appellant's account was not credible. The judge has also considered the witnesses and given valid reasons for discounting their evidence. 11. At Paragraph 115 of the decision the judge has started to consider the issue of the Facebook posts. The judge noted despite the fact that the appellant's account was that he had fled Iran by reason in part of threats from his family the appellant claims to have made friends of his family on Facebook. The judge has identified that this was a deliberate attempt by the appellant to fabricate a claim. That was a finding that the judge was entitled to make on the evidence presented. 12. The judge has given valid reasons for the finding that the appellant was not a genuine convert to Zoroastrianism. There is therefore no material error on the part of the judge in assessing whether the appellant had genuinely converted to Zoroastrianism.13. The issue thereafter is what would happen to the appellant on return and would the appellant be at risk because of his Facebook posts. On the basis of the findings of fact the judge was entitled to conclude that the Facebook posts were deliberately put out by the appellant in an effort to fabricate account of being a convert, see Danian 1999 EWCA Civ 3000 and that there would be no reason for the appellant not to delete the posts. The judge was entitled to conclude that there would be no reason for the authorities in Iran to be checking the appellant's Facebook posts prior to his returning there. 14. The sole issue to be determined is whether or not the appellant would on return be viewed or perceived by the authorities in Iran as a person that has renounced Islam by reason of his Facebook posts at the point of re-entering the country. The issue not being whether or not the appellant was a genuine convert, but whether the authorities in Iran on his return would, irrespective of whether he is a genuine convert, wish to see his face book posts and by reason thereof view him as an individual that had converted or had renounced Islam and would the appellant in those circumstances be at risk. 15. It does not appear that Judge Davies has dealt with that potential risk on return. In that respect Judge Davies has failed to make material findings on the risk on return. However that does not impact upon the rest of the determination. It is a separate issue that can be considered as a discrete issue. It is merely a matter for Judge Davies to make further findings of fact in accordance with case law cited, that is FSH and HB. 16. The judge would have to make findings as to whether or not the Facebook posts would have come to the attention of the Iranian authorities including at the point of return; what the consequence of such would be; whether the post could be deleted; and if the posts could be deleted what would be the reaction of the Iranian authorities. 17. It appears to me that the appropriate step is to direct that this matter be remitted back to Judge Davies for Judge Davies to complete the judgement in accordance with the case law referred to. The issue is whether or not the appellant by reason of his Facebook page would be viewed by potential persecutors as a person that has rejected Islam and viewed by them as a convert even though the appellant has not genuinely converted. Further whether the posts are a true reflection of his opinion or not is not the issue but whether given the posts the appellant would be at risk from the authorities in Iran by reason of their perception of his conduct.18. For the reasons set out I find that there is a material error of law and that the appropriate course is for this appeal to be remitted for Judge Davies to make findings as to whether if the appellant were returned to Iran on return he would be at risk because of the authorities' perception of the appellant given his Facebook posts. 19. On that basis the appropriate course is for the case to be remitted back to the First-tier for Judge Davies to determine the issues set outNotice of Decision20. I allow the appeal to the extent indicated and remit the appeal to the First-tier for Judge Davies to determine the issues identified.

I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it necessary to do so.3. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Doyle on 27th February 2019. Thus, the case appeared before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law in the decision.Factual Background4. The appellant was born in Pakistan on 1 January 1973. In 2006 he bought a business with a friend, Mr Baber who was allegedly a clerk in the Lahore Development Authority, and as part of that business purchased a plot of land from the friend for Rs.250,000. However it transpired that the land was not owned by his friend and the paperwork for the land was fake. 5. The appellant sought to recover his money from his friend. The appellant seems to have taken legal proceedings [see paragraph 23, 3rd indent paragraph] and to have been unsuccessful. Despite that Mr Baber promised to pay him some money. 6. However his friend then informed on the appellant to the ISA (ISI), an arm of the security services in Pakistan. The ISA seized the appellant, detained him for 2 weeks and beat him up, including a claim by the appellant that he was raped. 7. 2 or 3 weeks after his release from detention the appellant went to hospital. There is a hospital note, dated admission 27th April 2007, which indicates that the appellant had been involved in a road traffic accident. The appellant claims that he had to make that assertion as it was the only way in which he could get medical treatment for his injuries.8. The appellant claims that he sought to complain to the police but they said that they could not take any action against the agency. The appellant claims that Mr Baber is part of a Mafia and is a DOM (Don) a leader of the group. Mr Baber is always surrounded by bodyguards with guns.9. The appellant then claims that he left Pakistan on the 6th or 7th August 2008. After the detention and mistreatment, the appellant remained in Pakistan for over 1 year and 5 months an does not describe anything else happening in that time. 10. The appellant claimed to have arrived in the UK on the 1st January 2009 by plane. The appellant only claimed asylum on the 18th April 2018. By notice dated the 5th October 2018 the appellant's claim to asylum was refused. 11. The appellant appealed and the appeal was listed to be heard on the 19th November 2018. The notice of hearing was sent out on the 22nd October 2018.12. A Pre-hearing review was conducted on the papers and at that stage the appellant's representatives were claiming that they were waiting for medical reports. No application for an adjournment was made. At the hearing a note from the appellant's GP stated that certain scars on the appellant were cigarette burns but such reports did not comply with the Istanbul Protocol.13. At the hearing Mr Karnik applied for an adjournment on the basis that they wished to instruct a medical expert to consider the burn scars on the appellant. The judge considered the application and refused it. 14. The grounds of appeal seek to suggest that the judge in accordance with the case of Naigwe 2014 UKUT 00418 should have granted an adjournment and the failure to grant an adjournment is an error of law in that the judge could not deal with the appeal fairly and justly with the case without the medical report. It is claimed that the judge's approach to the availability of the medical evidence has infected the judge's findings on credibility generally.15. Firstly, I would note that as a part of the decision the judge had noted that the appellant had not raised any risk in any other part of Pakistan and that the appellant had at the time of his leaving Pakistan an internal relocation option. It had not been shown that it would have been unduly harsh for the appellant to have internally relocated. Further the judge was satisfied that the appellant could still internally relocate within Pakistan without it being unduly harsh to expect him to do so. [see paragraphs 40 & 41] . Thus, whether the appellant had been subjected to mistreatment the judge found that the appellant was not at risk in other parts of Pakistan.16. The appellant had remained in Pakistan for 1 year and 5 months and had not had any further problems. Whilst he claimed to have tried to lodge a complaint against the ISA or ISI, he states that he was told he could not lodge a complaint against them. However, nothing had happened to the appellant for a significant period of time. 17. The finding on internal relocation alone would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal on the basis of protection.18. Further I would not that the issues raised do not raise any convention reason as required in asylum. 19. With regard to the application for an adjournment, the appellant had been in the UK for over 11 years before making his claim to asylum/international protection. The appellant had had every opportunity to seek legal advice and obtain medical evidence to confirm that his scars were cigarette burns prior to claiming asylum but no medical evidence had been adduced save a report from the GP produced shortly before the hearing. The appellant had made a conscious decision to claim asylum but allegedly was still reluctant to give a full and frank account. The appellant had only raised the scarring at the last minute. 20. An adjournment was being sought for an assessment to be made of scars that were according to the appellant over 12 years old. Given that the representatives had been aware of the issue of the scars and injuries at least at the time of the PHR and given that there was no timetable for such a report the judge was entitled to consider that the appellant had had ample time to put his claim in order. The judge was entitled to proceed with the appeal and determine the appeal on the evidence before him.21. The judge had noted significant credibility issues with the appellant's account. The judge noted that appellant had taken legal action not against Mr Baber but against the plot. The appellant was a business man and if an individual had defrauded him he would know that the action was against the fraudster not against anyone else. [see question 102 in the interview]. The judge also noted that the appellant would have noted buildings on the plot of land and as a business man would have made enquiry about the property. The refusal letter had noted the inconsistencies in the dates in the appellant's account. 22. The judge took specific note of the medical admission note from Pakistan which stated that the appellant had been in a car accident. The appellant had claimed that it was only by making that claim that he could get treatment. Again, the judge doubted the credibility of the appellant's account.23. It is also to be noted that the appellant had made an application to come to the UK in 2008 on a visit visa and that application was refused. 24. The judge has carefully considered the appellant's account and given valid reasons for finding that the appellant would in any event have been able to internally relocate. The judge has gone on to consider the appellant's claim in detail and given valid reasons for finding that the appellant had not told the truth. The judge has taken account of the GP's assessment of the scars but otherwise has given valid reasons for rejecting the appellant's account. 25. For the reasons set out there is no material error of law in the decision. The judge has fully justified the conclusions reached and was entitled given the length of time that the appellant had been in the UK to proceed with the hearing and make the findings that he has.

The Appellant is a citizen of Iran. He made an application for international protection which was refused. He appealed and following a hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 5 December 2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Arullendran, dismissed his appeal on all grounds. 2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. It was granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy on 18 January 2019. His reasons for so granting were: - ""1. On 5 December 2018, FtT Judge Arullendran dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal of his protection claim because she decided the appellant was not a refugee from Iran or otherwise in need of international protection. The judge also decided the appellant did not benefit from article 3 or 8 ECHR.2. On 14 December 2018, the FtT received an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The application is in time.3. The grounds argue the judge erred in law by: (i) relying on her own internet search for the appellant's Facebook page rather than the printouts provided, (ii) finding the printouts did not indicate whether the Facebook account was public or private and therefore ignoring the ""add friend"" button indicated the account was public, (iii) ignoring the fact the appellant's 4,000 Facebook friends include Christians and non-Christians and not taking this into consideration when assessing the appellant's evangelical activities since all his friends could read his posts promoting Christianity, (iv) failing to consider the likelihood that the Iranian authorities may have viewed the appellant's Facebook page and thereby the risk the appellant has been identified as an evangelising Christian, (v) failing to give adequate reasons for disregarding the written testimony of people the appellant has evangelised, (vi) failing to give adequate reasons for disregarding the oral and written evidence of two ministers, and (vii) making inconsistent findings about the appellant's church activities.4. I find it is arguable the judge should not have engaged in internet research during the hearing because she did not afford the appellant an effective opportunity to rebut that allegation. This may have affected the fairness of the hearing and the judge's attitude towards the appellant's other evidence. I also mention that it is unlikely that a person will have 4,300 followers on Facebook if an account is private and this factor appears to have been ignored. The printouts do indicate an ""add friend"" button which appears to have been overlooked by the judge.5. I find it is arguable that reposting positive information about Christianity might be viewed as evangelising. I think it is arguable that the judge erred when apply the principles in AB because this was a case where the appellant gave an explanation how the Iranian authorities may have been alerted to his activities by his paternal cousin (see [35]) and that has not been considered. I also find it arguable that the judge failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting written evidence from people the appellant says he evangelised and from one of his ministers. It is arguably inadequate reject evidence merely for non-attendance of a witness, particularly when the lower standard of proof applies, and recalling that corroboration is not a requirement.6. I also find it is arguable that the judge gives insufficient reasons for rejecting the opinion of the minister who attended the hearing that the appellant was a genuine convert. The situation had moved on significantly since the earlier judicial decision and the minister had been preparing the appellant for baptism which suggests a close knowledge of his intentions.""3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.4. At today's hearing Mrs Brajak sought to rely upon the grounds seeking permission to appeal.5. Mrs Petterson conceded that the Judge had materially erred with particular reference to the content of paragraph 34 of her decision which, given the way the Judge treated the evidence and found that she herself was unable to locate his Facebook site via google there was procedural unfairness. I find for all the reasons highlighted by Designated Judge McCarthy in his grant of permission to appeal as being arguable the Judge has in fact materially erred. There is no alternative in the circumstances but for this matter to be reheard de novo before the First-tier Tribunal.Notice of DecisionThe making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be dealt with afresh pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Direction 7(b) before any Judge aside from Judge Arullendran.Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of their family. This direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.

16,PA/07424/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/07424/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 22 February 2019 and 15 May 2019 On 31 May 2019      Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE SYMES Between RAA (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE) Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Ms R Popal (counsel instructed by Barnes Harrild and Dyer) For the Respondent: Mr Melvin & Ms Cunha (Senior Home Office Presenting Officers) DECISION AND REASONS This is the appeal of RAA, a citizen of Iran born 4 October 2001, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge O’Malley) of 7 December 2018 to dismiss his appeal, itself brought against the Respondent’s decision of 29 May 2018 to refuse his application to be recognised as a refugee. RAA arrived in the UK on 9 May 2017 in the back of a lorry. Although his asylum application was refused, he was granted Discretionary Leave to Remain on the basis of being an unaccompanied minor until 4 April 2019. RAA’s asylum claim was that he faced discrimination for being a Kurd and a Sunni Muslim, and the prospect of serious harm due to his father’s actions. His father worked as a prison guard. One evening in late February 2017 his father came home and told RAA and the rest of the family that they would have to flee the country; a fuller explanation would be given once they were on their way. His parents packed up clothes and food for the journey, and left the country together. Once in Greece, his mother told the Appellant that his father had been paid by a prisoner’s relatives to arrange his release. However, his father failed to secure the prisoner’s release, notwithstanding having spent the money. His father was then threatened with serious consequences if he failed to either fulfil his side of the bargain or return the money. He travelled to the UK via Turkey, Greece, and countries unknown, having been separated from his family when entering the lorry. In the course of his account the Appellant referred to having an uncle and aunt remaining in Iran, in Sardasht; social media searches had failed to re-establish contact with them since he left the country. Supporting evidence included a number of reports from Professor Joffe. One report of 30 September 2012 stated that Kurdish failed asylum seekers faced “an enhanced threat of being considered a priori to have defamed the Islamic Republic while abroad … Previously the Iranian authorities required positive evidence of offences that would be considered specifically political in nature … Now that is a basic assumption which an accused person will have to disprove, so that the burden of proof has shifted significantly against an asylum seeker who has been returned … returned Kurds face particular scrutiny and thus the danger of further accusations being laid against them.” A further report of 2 March 2016 referred to tensions running high through Iranian Kurdistan, ensuring that official attitudes remained hostile and repressive, and that any Kurdish returnee would have to anticipate serious risk of official discrimination if not persecution, and that they would face “particular scrutiny” given that Kurdish protests were savagely repressed due to fears of external interference and Kurdish activism over the ISIS threat; the Iranian government disproportionately targeted minority groups; legislation was employed against the Kurds for exercising their rights to freedom of expression; Kurds were frequently and disproportionately punished for the “catch-all” offences of “crimes against God”; and the execution rate had accelerated. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that it was not appropriate to make any credibility findings adverse to the Appellant, bearing in mind the limited role he could reasonably be assumed to have had in the decisions behind his family’s flight from Iran and his journey to the UK. It accepted that his father was a prison guard, and the country evidence that bribery of such guards was widespread. It was plausible that the Appellant's father would have taken a bribe, given this was a regular aspect of detention in Iran. However, no guarantee could be given that the bribe would secure the release of its intended beneficiaries, and it was inconsistent that a family with the reach and influence to seriously threaten the Appellant's family would rely on a payment to a prison guard who was discriminated against and held back from promotion (this being a matter of which RAA had heard his father complain). The Judge decided that Professor Joffe’s reports were to be given limited weight, being generic in nature, and the opinions therein were not to be preferred to the conclusions in Country Guidelines decisions. The Tribunal went on to find that Whilst being Kurdish gave a Convention ground of membership of a particular social group, the Appellant would not face persecution on that basis, given that his father’s lack of career advancement did not represent serious harm such as reach the persecution threshold and as there was no evidence of persecution of family members, and the Appellant's father’s behaviour would not be considered to be out of the ordinary in the context of the expectations on prison officers; The Appellant was to be presumed to have left Iran illegally, given he would not have had a document to secure his lawful exit: the Judge was not satisfied that he did not have a passport when he left Iran, but accepted he lacked one by the time he reached the UK; the Appellant would not be at risk of serious harm for this reason, citing SSH and HR: “An Iranian male in respect of whom no adverse interest has previously been manifested by the Iranian State does not face a real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights on return to Iran on account of having left Iran illegally and/or being a failed asylum seeker. No such risk exists at the time of questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of illegal exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have been established. In particular, there is not a real risk of prosecution leading to imprisonment.” The Appellant would not be at risk as a failed asylum seeker as his family were not suggested as being politically active, and he would have family to whom he could return in order to avoid him facing destitution. Grounds of appeal alleged the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law because There was no valid reason to afford the report of George Joffe limited weight and it was unfair to do so, no challenge having been made to their contents by the Respondent, without giving notice of the possibility – accordingly the First-tier Tribunal had wrongly discounted the risks to Kurds, the growing concerns about Kurdish activism, the general targeting of minority groups and the continued tension in the area, and wrongly treated the risks faced by the Appellant to be governed only by SSH and HR without regard to HB (Iran); It wrongly treated SSH and HR as being Country Guidelines vis-á-vis the risks faced by returnees of Kurdish ethnicity when the Upper Tribunal had expressly confirmed the contrary in HB (Iran); It made speculative findings without an evidential basis: As where it concluded that the payment of a bribe could not guarantee a prisoner’s release, thereby inferring that this would be self-evident to anyone seeking to procure such a result who would therefore have no reasonable animus to cause them to pursue the Appellant's father; In failing to take account of the possibility that the reason why the family had not suffered serious harm whilst in Iran was the speed of their flight from the country, and In determining that the Appellant would have relatives to which to return in Iran without identifying any such extended family. Permission to appeal was granted on 8 January 2019 on the basis of no valid reasons being given for discounting the weight to be afforded the expert reports. A Rule 24 response submitted that the reports of Dr Joffe were justifiably rejected, because they were generic in nature, dated from 2012-2015, not related to this Appellant, not properly disclosable in these proceedings, failed to explain via independent evidence that the opinions expressed therein had been judicially accepted, and did not explain the basis upon which the report might justify depart from the previously extant Country Guidelines. Before me, Ms Popal submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had overlooked material evidence and made conclusions now shown to be untenable in the light of HB (Iran). Mr Melvin submitted that it was not tenable that all Kurds were at risk; this appeal had no merit, and that was effectively recognised by the manner in which the case had been argued today, whose underlying case theory sought to rely upon that very proposition. The new Country Guidelines decision could not undermine a First-tier Tribunal decision which pre-dated it. Decision and reasons – Error of law hearing The Country Guidelines regime is described in the Practice Directions of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal: “12.2 … [a] country guidance case is authoritative in any subsequent appeal, so far as that appeal: (a) relates to the country guidance issue in question; and (b) depends upon the same or similar evidence. … 12.4 Because of the principle that like cases should be treated in like manner, any failure to follow a clear, apparently applicable country guidance case or to show why it does not apply to the case in question is likely to be regarded as grounds for appeal on a point of law.” The proper approach to Country Guidelines decisions has been litigated over time. The following propositions have been established. Stanley Burnton LJ in SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA Civ 940 §47 stated that “decision makers and tribunal judges are required to take Country Guidance determinations into account, and to follow them unless very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence, are adduced justifying their not doing so”; Simon LJ in ST (Afghanistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 2382 observed that the headnote to a Country Guidelines decision showed the content that was of general applicability – the relevance of other findings will depend on the particular facts of the case and whether the issue depends on similar evidence; In PR (Sri Lanka) [2017] EWCA Civ 1946, McCombe LJ cautioned against reliance on isolated passages of evidence in a Country Guidelines decision that had been cited for completeness and which appeared to play no part in the final decision; Wilson LJ (as he then was) at §24-25 of RK (Algeria) [2007] EWCA Civ 868 essentially held that the Tribunal remained seized of the case until such time as the determination was promulgated on 16 July 2014: “24. [counsel submitted that if] there is in the course of delay in the Tribunal's preparing or promulgating a decision a substantial change for the better in the relevant circumstances which obtain in the foreign country, it is highly undesirable that no cognisance can be taken of itI … [Ravichandran] held that judicial determinations made within the immigration appellate structure were to be regarded as an extension of the decision-making process and so in principle should be based upon circumstances as they are at the time of those determinations rather than at any earlier stage. … 25. There has to come a time, however, at which the opportunity for judicial survey of up-to-date evidence stops. Under our system, and save in exceptional circumstances, it stops upon promulgation of the Tribunal's determination; and so it has stopped by the time when the case reaches this court.” Flaux LJ in NA (Libya) [2017] EWCA Civ 143 [2018] EWCA Civ 2382 concluded that as a general rule, the fact that a determination of the First Tier Tribunal is inconsistent with a Country Guidelines case issued after its promulgation will not amount to an error of law. However this analysis would not apply where the Country Guidelines decision has been promulgated before that of the lower Tribunal. It can accordingly be seen that there was no material error of law caused by the First-tier Tribunal failing to take account of the decision in HB (Iran): the Country Guidelines decision was promulgated on 12 December 2018 whereas the decision appealed was promulgated on 7 December 2018. Accordingly the principle identified in NA (Libya) governed the case: the Country Guidelines decision post-dated the First-tier Tribunal’s decision, and was thus not to be treated as governing similar factual issues. Nevertheless, it seemed to me that there were material errors of law in the decision below. The issues raised in the country evidence before the First-tier Tribunal required careful scrutiny. That evidence included number of reports by Professor Joffe, which Mr Popal informed me (and I have no reason to doubt) were before the Upper Tribunal in HB (Iran). It is clear that the opinion evidence therein demanded close attention. As HB (Iran) post-dated the promulgation of the decision now appealed, the conclusions of the Tribunal there are not strictly relevant to the Upper Tribunal’s function in this appeal when identifying whether a material “error of law” has been committed. However, the fact that the HB (Iran) Tribunal clearly accepted that material of this nature was relevant to its conclusion that the situation for returning Kurds had worsened demonstrated the general force of the material. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal may well come to a different conclusion on the risk faced by the Appellant had it had regard to these reports rather than simply ruling them out of account. I did not consider that the Secretary of State’s objections to reliance on these reports were made out. Professor Joffe’s opinions have often been given weight in immigration appeals; his expertise speaks for itself. It was unnecessary for the reports to justify the extent to which they invited departure from the pre-existing Country Guidelines, because there were no such relevant Guidelines. The First-tier Tribunal clearly considered that SSH and HR provided Country Guidelines for Kurds returning to Iran. However, that was not the case. This should have been clear from the decision itself, without the need for the point to be made in HB (Iran). However, the new Country Guidelines decision makes the point clear (via language strongly indicating that this was self-evident from the text of SSH and HR itself) §98(1): “For the avoidance of doubt, that decision is not authority for any proposition in relation to the risk on return for refused Kurdish asylum-seekers on account of their Kurdish ethnicity alone.” Accordingly observations on the country evidence on the risks facing Kurdish returnees in SSH and HR fell to be treated in line with the reasoning in PR (Sri Lanka and ST (Afghanistan): ie as potentially relevant material, but certainly not as a procrustean bed against which the Appellant's claim was to be exclusively measured. The crux of the Appellant's claim was that, whether or not some adverse action might be taken against his family by those who had bribed his father, he would face a disproportionate reaction on a return to Iran as a Kurd whose father had taken a bribe from a powerful family in order to secure the release of a prisoner. If questioned by the authorities on a return, the Appellant’s father might well have to explain the fact that he had received a bribe and chosen not to action it; that decision might have consequences for his family members, depending on the authorities’ reaction. The proposition that this would simply be discounted by the authorities without further investigation or punishment as run-of-the-mill prison officer behaviour seemed highly unlikely. It was here that the evidence from Professor Joffe referring to an increase in the suspicions of officialdom in relation to Kurds generally demanded express treatment. HB (Iran) was to subsequently summarise the Upper Tribunal’s own conclusions, driven partly by his opinion evidence, as being that the authorities showed a “hair trigger” attitude in their attitude to Kurdish returnees. I accordingly considered that there was a material error of law in the decision appealed. As the remaining issues were of limited scope, it was appropriate to retain the appeal in the Upper Tribunal. No error of law having been alleged or identified in the acceptance of the Appellant’s credibility, those findings would stand for the continuation hearing. However the appropriate inferences to be drawn from those findings must be re-determined. In my error of law decision, I indicated that the Country Guidelines in HB (Iran) would be relevant to the final decision on this appeal, albeit that some of the opinion evidence of Professor Joffe on which reliance was placed below was not accepted as made out to the relevant standard of proof, for example his opinion that Kurds effectively faced a reverse burden of proof, and his suggestion that all returning Kurds might face a real risk of persecution. At the continuation hearing, the parties agreed that it was appropriate for the appeal to be determined on the basis of submissions only, no factual issue remaining in dispute. Ms Popal submitted that the core facts were that the Appellant’s father had conducted himself in a way that the Iranian authorities might well see as having made a stand against the country itself, and in consequence the Appellant had exited Iran illegally. The Iranian regime might well act in a way that would seem perverse to decision makers in a democracy, but that was nevertheless a real possibility. The Country Guidelines showed that the consequences of the sins of the parents might well be visited on their children, and this was a risk that had to be combined with that of being a failed asylum seeker, and with the evidence that the authorities took a “hair trigger” approach. The Appellant had limited family ties left in Iran, as there was no evidence that he had successfully re-established contact with his uncle and aunt in Iran, and he had lost contact with his father and mother in Greece, which was not untypical of events during the flight of asylum seekers across national borders. The very fact the Secretary of State had granted him leave to remain as a minor showed that it was established that there were no relatives remaining in Iran who would be available to care for him in the future. Iimputed political opinion was central to the Appellant's claim, and the opinions attributed to Kurds were very broad, see eg HB (8) capturing “social welfare and charitable activities on behalf of Kurds.” Ms Cunha submitted the grant of leave was founded on section 55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 duties, which had a protective basis and should not carry over into the asylum determination process. It remained the case that he had relatives in Iran who were shopkeepers which suggested that there were no dangers to his father’s relatives generally there. Whilst Iranian prison conditions would pose a real risk of Article 3 violations, the evidence did not establish the Appellant would actually face imprisonment on return. HB could be distinguished: the illegal exit of a minor per se would not cause problems on a return, and HB was the son of KDPI political activists who had been killed by the Iranian authorities, whereas here the father’s activities were wholly apolitical, and there had been no UK political activities, so it could not be said that the regime’s approach to political dissidence would carry over to his particular circumstances This appeal raises the relatively short point as to whether the son of a Kurdish prison guard who grossly failed in his duties by accepting bribes to secure a prisoner’s release would be at risk from the authorities. I join with the First-tier Tribunal in ruling out any real risk from the family whose bribe had failed to procure the intended result: they would be non-state actors and there is no evidence that they would have any reach across the territory of Iran generally or even within the Kurdish areas. However, the potential risk faced from the authorities is a rather different matter. The conclusions in HB (Iran) concentrate on the increasing suspicion that attaches to Kurdish political activities of any scale rather than on the possibility that a person’s actions, themselves ostensibly politically neutral, may attract punishment (for themselves or their family members) that is aggravated by racially or politically motivated considerations. Nevertheless, the Country Guidance clearly has some value by analogy. The Upper Tribunal in HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 430 (IAC) concluded “(1) SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC) remains valid country guidance in terms of the country guidance offered in the headnote. For the avoidance of doubt, that decision is not authority for any proposition in relation to the risk on return for refused Kurdish asylum-seekers on account of their Kurdish ethnicity alone. (2) Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the evidence does not support a contention that such discrimination is, in general, at such a level as to amount to persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. (3) Since 2016 the Iranian authorities have become increasingly suspicious of, and sensitive to, Kurdish political activity. Those of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even greater suspicion than hitherto and are reasonably likely to be subjected to heightened scrutiny on return to Iran. (4) However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish ethnicity with or without a valid passport, and even if combined with illegal exit, does not create a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. (5) Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when combined with other factors, may create a real risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. Being a risk factor it means that Kurdish ethnicity is a factor of particular significance when assessing risk. Those “other factors” will include the matters identified in paragraphs (6)-(9) below. (6) A period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish returnee is reasonably likely to result in additional questioning by the authorities on return. However, this is a factor that will be highly fact-specific and the degree of interest that such residence will excite will depend, non-exhaustively, on matters such as the length of residence in the KRI, what the person concerned was doing there and why they left. (7) Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups or activity are at risk of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the Iranian authorities. Even Kurds expressing peaceful dissent or who speak out about Kurdish rights also face a real risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. (8) Activities that can be perceived to be political by the Iranian authorities include social welfare and charitable activities on behalf of Kurds. Indeed, involvement with any organised activity on behalf of or in support of Kurds can be perceived as political and thus involve a risk of adverse attention by the Iranian authorities with the consequent risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. (9) Even ‘low-level’ political activity, or activity that is perceived to be political, such as, by way of example only, mere possession of leaflets espousing or supporting Kurdish rights, if discovered, involves the same risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment. Each case however, depends on its own facts and an assessment will need to be made as to the nature of the material possessed and how it would be likely to be viewed by the Iranian authorities in the context of the foregoing guidance. (10) The Iranian authorities demonstrate what could be described as a ‘hair-trigger’ approach to those suspected of or perceived to be involved in Kurdish political activities or support for Kurdish rights. By ‘hair-trigger’ it means that the threshold for suspicion is low and the reaction of the authorities is reasonably likely to be extreme.” The Upper Tribunal also found, in HB §93: “In relation to a child whose parents disappeared more than 20 years ago, it is quite possible that a child would be regarded as equally dangerous as the parents. It might be assumed that he would be hostile towards them for that reason alone. The crucial thing is the male line.” The Secretary of State has published a Country Policy and Information Note Iran: Illegal exit (Version 5.0 February 2019) which states: “6.1.4 The 2018 DFAT report stated: ‘According to Article 34 of the Penal Code, the penalty for leaving the country without a valid passport (or similar travel document) is between one and three years’ imprisonment, or a fine of between 100,000 and 500,000 rials (AUD4-20). A special court located in Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport deals with [cases of people leaving the country without a valid passport or similar travel document] … The court assesses the background of the individual, the date of their departure from the country, the reason for their illegal departure, their connection with any organisations or groups, and any other circumstances. This procedure also applies to people who are deported back to Iran and who are not in possession of a passport containing an exit visa. DFAT understands that illegal departure is often prosecuted in conjunction with other unrelated offences.” Another relevant document from the Home Office is the Country Information and Guidance Iran: Prison conditions (Version 1.0 February 2016): “2.4 Are prison conditions so poor that prisoners are at real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2.4.1 Prison conditions in Iran are harsh and often life-threatening with severe overcrowding, poor ventilation, extreme temperatures, poor sanitary conditions including a lack of access to clean drinking water and a lack of sufficient toilet facilities. There is a serious lack of access to the appropriate medical care. In a number of cases sick prisoners have been denied adequate medical care, including medication. Food at some prisons has a low nutrional value and they have been reports of many detainees being malnourished. Authorities mixed violent and nonviolent offender populations. Political prisoners in some prisons are subject to forced labour. 2.4.2 Torture and mistreatment are also common within prisons in Iran. Whilst officials claim that no one is subjected to torture detained prisoners often report forced confessions, prolonged solitary confinement, rape, physical and psychological torture and mock executions. There were reports of systematic rape of women prisoners as well as coerced virginity testing of female prisoners. 2.4.3 The government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions and sometimes prisoners were subjected to threats after they lodged complaints with the authorities. The Iranian authorities have frequently failed to conduct independent investigations into allegations of torture and other ill-treatment by officials, which has contributed to a pervasive culture of impunity. 2.4.4 Prison conditions in Iran are, in individual cases, likely to create a real risk of torture and/or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2.4.5 Decision makers must consider each case on its facts. For the factors to be considered and further information, see Section 3.4 of the Asylum Instruction on Humanitarian Protection.” Professor Joffe has repeatedly stated that “the Iranian authorities assume that all asylum seekers who are returned to Iran have engaged in anti-regime activities whilst abroad, especially in spreading false information about the Islamic republic” (eg §119 of October 2014 report). Drawing the themes together from this evidence, it seems to me that there is a real risk that the Appellant would face serious harm on a return to Iran. He cannot be expected to lie on return, and is likely to have to justify his departure, given that it was presumably via an illegal exit. So it must be assumed that he will give a similar account to the Iranian authorities as to the Home Office here. It is not difficult to envisage that a repressive regime which takes a “hair trigger” attitude to Kurdish returnees will look unkindly on the actions of a prison guard who took a bribe to release someone who was necessarily of interest to the authorities. As the Tribunal once stated in Suleyman (16242; 11 February 1998): “It is clear to us that a repressive regime ... may well act in ways which defy logical analysis. A person who is genuinely a victim of such a regime may well find that the partial account he is able to give of its activities as they have affected him is not something which will stand up to a strictly logical analysis. The regime may seem to govern by confusion; it may engage in other activities, of which the Appellant knows nothing; it may simply behave in a way which a person sitting in safety in the United Kingdom might regard as almost beyond belief’.” In the light of the evidence that almost any conduct can attract adverse attention from the Iranian authorities, I also accept that there is a real chance that their reaction would be motivated by a political opinion being attributed to the Appellant’s father. It is clear that any conduct capable of being seen as anti-regime may lead to political suspicions. The more significant concern is whether the Appellant himself would be at risk. Absent any evidence either way, I would probably have inferred that he was not at risk; it would be surprising, in the normal course of events, for a country’s authorities to visit the consequences of a parent’s behaviour on a child who was not otherwise associated with their activities. However, given the possibility that a Kurdish political activist’s child could be persecuted for political reasons solely down to a parent’s actions twenty years after the relevant political activity, it seems to me that there is a real risk that a similar animus would be visited on the child of a delinquent Kurdish prison guard a relatively short time after the original offence took place.

The respondent (by whom I refer to the Secretary of State for the Home Department) appeals against the decision of Judge Mitchell to allow the appellant's appeal under Article 8 and grounds that the Immigration Rules ought to be met. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Saffer gave the respondent permission on 18 February 2019, even though the decision had been promulgated the previous October, because he was of the view that it was arguable that the judge had made a material error of law in making conflicting findings of fact as alleged in the application. Background2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 23 March 1956. 3. The asylum application was made on 20 January 2017 and was refused on 20 July 2017. In the decision letter the respondent set out the background to the appeal. It seems the appellant originally came to the UK having made an online application in February 2015. However, she returned to Bangladesh but re-entered the UK on 22 May 2016. Again, she returns to Bangladesh from the UK on 13 November 2016 to find another woman in her house with whom her husband claimed to have married. The appellant's husband locked the appellant in a room, physically assaulted her and tortured her before forcing her to sign certain papers. An alternative claim was put forward that she lived in Bangladesh alone with financial support from her daughter for twenty years after divorcing her husband ten years previously. She claimed that she had a son in Bangladesh who was mentally underdeveloped, however, there was no indication of his whereabouts, and alternatively she had a son who lived with her sister whilst she was in the UK. She claimed to have diabetes and she claimed to have high blood pressure. She also claimed that her husband would kill her if she returned to Bangladesh. 4. She had applied for a visit visa on 8 April 2016 which was granted on 19 April 2016. As has been explained, she left Bangladesh on 22 May 2016 and arrived in the UK the same day, returning to Bangladesh in November 2016. Again, she left Bangladesh and came back to London Heathrow on 3 December 2016. She was refused leave to enter the UK with a right of appeal on 3 December 2016 but was allowed temporary admission on 4 December 2016 with removal directions set for 18 December 2016. It was shortly after that period that she submitted her asylum claim. The hearing 5. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the respondent, through Miss Kiss, explained that the judge had dismissed the asylum application finding it not to be credible. He had had regard to an expert report from Dr Halari but had engaged minimally with that report. The appellant clearly suffered from a language difficulty and did not speak English well. The judge nevertheless went on to decides appeal should be allowed ""under paragraph 27 ADEA (1 (VI) of the immigration and under article 8 ECHR"". It was submitted that Judge Mitchell had appeared to reach contradictory findings in relation to the extent of the appellant's cognitive impairment, saying at one point that she had deliberately ""embellished and exaggerated"" her evidence (see paragraph 52) but at paragraph 51 had accepted a degree of cognitive disability. Furthermore, the judge found that her cognitive impairment had deteriorated since her arrival into the UK. One finding that stands out, Miss Kiss pointed out, is that she had lived alone for twenty years, but that was a clear finding. In essence she submitted that the decision of Judge Mitchell did not make any sense, the reasons did not support the conclusions. 6. Miss Anzani for the appellant, on the other hand, said that it had been accepted by the judge that the appellant had been a victim of domestic violence and although there had been an asylum claim which had been rejected against which there had been no appeal, Judge Mitchell had clearly reached a view as to the degree of the appellant's cognitive impairment, and explained the societal difficulties which the appellant would encounter in returning to Bangladesh, given the background and the finding in this case of domestic violence. The judge had given comprehensive reasons and the respondent had simply ""cherry-picked"" passages from the decision which appeared to contradict one another, and this had not been fair. It was acknowledged that the judge had been critical of the psychologist's report but, overall, he had he had overall accepted its conclusions.Conclusions 7. Following the hearing of all submissions I considered a copy of Dr Halari's report. It contains a number of surprising conclusions. Of greater surprise is the fact that the judge appears to go each way in his decision reaching findings that are contradictory. The appellant has a family support network including a sister in Bangladesh. The judge found that she had a cognitive deterioration but overall he did not seem to regard this as significant because he rejected much of the psychologist's assessment saying he had reservations about it and saying that his assessment had not been to the gold standard that would be expected. He described the appellant's evidence in material respects as being embellished and exaggerated and he said the appellant had not been honest in the past about her reasons for coming to the UK. He considered her credibility to be adversely affected, and although he seems to have accepted there was some cognitive impairment to the appellant and therefore some negative impact in returning her to Bangladesh, he did not consider the evidence showed any negative psychological impact on the family as a whole. 8. He considered Miss Anzani's submissions but looked at the case through the prism of Article 8 having considered the requirements of the Immigration Rules and anyway would have no right of appeal against the decision under the Immigration Rules. He took into account the case of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11. He clearly recognised that the appellant did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules because she had not lived in the UK for twenty years, having lived here for only two years. He then went on to make a finding that the appellant had a deteriorating degree of cognitive ability needing help with daily things such as dressing, feeding, washing and help with her balance, but he said that the circumstances were such that the obstacles she would face in Bangladesh were very significant and would engage paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules. He claimed to have taken into account the strength of public policy in immigration control in the case and considered whether it outweighed the strength of the Article 8 claim. He decided that the asylum claim was not credible. There was, the judge found, was no credible evidence that she would face a real risk of return as a failed asylum seeker. Nevertheless, the judge went on to conclude that the decision was disproportionate and allowed it under Article 8 and under 276ADE(1)(vi). 9. However, I agree with Judge Saffer's observation, when granting permission, that the findings appear to conflict with each other and with the conclusions and there is no proper Article 8 analysis as there should be prior to reaching the conclusion that he reached. The judge seems to have reached a negative view of the appellant's credibility and to have rejected some of her evidence, for example, the expert report of Dr Halari, yet went on to allow the appeal. In the circumstances, I agree with Miss Kiss that the judge's decision did not make sufficient sense for it to be allowed to stand. Whether this was simply because of a lack of careful attention to the decision writing, or whether there are more fundamental errors, does not seem important. What matters is that both sides can understand from reading the decision how this the judge has reached his conclusion.10. Both parties agree that, on finding a material error of law in these circumstances, the decision of the FTT needs to be set-aside and a de novo hearing ordered. The appeal needs to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the further hearing to take place. Notice of Decision 11. The appeal by the respondent against the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal is allowed. 12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. 13. I direct, as I have been invited to by both the parties, that the matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing to take place before a different judge other than Judge Mitchell. Directions 1. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (not before Judge Mitchell) for a de novo hearing 2. No findings will be preserved.3. A Bengali interpreter will be required.4.

18,PA/04408/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/04408/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 15 May 2019 On 31 May 2019      Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE SYMES Between HAIDER [H] (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE) Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr A Eaton (for Duncan Lewis Solicitors) For the Respondent: Ms S Cunha (Specialist Appeals Team) DECISION AND REASONS This is the appeal of Haider [H], a citizen of Afghanistan born 1 January 1989, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal of 1 March 2019, itself brought against the Secretary of State’s decision (of 3 April 2018) to refuse his asylum application. The Appellant originally entered the UK on 1 April 2008, claimed asylum, based on his difficulties due to his activities with Hezb-e-Islami, his appeal being dismissed. Judge Mace rejected the Appellant's account of six months of personal involvement with Hezb-e-Islami, but accepted that it was possible that the Appellant's father was involved with Hezb-e-Islami and may even have been killed fighting for them. Nevertheless, the Appellant had not established he was not at risk of persecution, having regard to the lack of any evidence of difficulties with the authorities and the finding in PM Afghanistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00089 that there was no satisfactory evidence that a person who has been associated in the past with Hizb-i-Islami will always be regarded as such. Once his appeal rights were exhausted, the Appellant was removed to Afghanistan on 19 February 2013. He returned to Europe and claimed asylum in Sweden on 6 November 2015; Sweden returned him to the UK on 10 May 2016, where he lodged further submissions on arrival. His claim on his return to the UK as summarised in the refusal letter is that he was kidnapped and interrogated by the Taliban because of his westernised mannerisms, and accused of being a spy. He was detained for four nights. He was then released with the village elders acting as his guarantors, as a result of which he was unable to leave the village. In 2015 he was taken by from the mosque by the Taliban and required to fight against ISIS. He was allowed to return home after the fighting, but the Taliban returned to require him to fight again. His brother told the Taliban that he was not at home, and reported back to the Appellant that they required him to be at home the next day. His brother subsequently told the Taliban that the Appellant would not fight for them again, and was beaten by them. The Appellant decided to take revenge, following them to a stream where he shot one of them in the shoulder with an AK47 gun. The Appellant then fled to Tawai on foot, remaining there for three days before travelling to Saroubi, where he met with an agent who took him on to Sweden. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept the Appellant's evidence as credible, because It was implausible that he would be viewed as westernised if he had previously helped his father with Hezb-e-Islami (and thus anti-government) activities such as distributing leaflets, and had lived in a house where ammunition was stored, and in any event any such suspicions must have been very short-lived given that he was quickly persuaded to fight on the Taliban’s behalf; There was a discrepancy between the Appellant's evidence and the summary of his case apparently provided to the psychiatrist by his representative, and between the witness statement and the account he gave to the psychiatrist as to the circumstances in which he came to the Taliban’s attention prior to his detention by them; It was implausible that he would take up arms against the Taliban themselves having refused to accept the dangers involved in fighting the police; His account had “no factual support” and his record on credibility was not good. Accordingly the Tribunal concluded that the Appellant had either fabricated his claim in its entirety, or exaggerated the real events. The First-tier Tribunal noted that AS Afghanistan established that Kabul was generally safe for a healthy young adult, which was the Appellant's situation subject to the psychiatric report. There were factual issues regarding that report as addressed above. The Appellant had raised no psychiatric issues when he came to the UK in 2008 and whatever he had suffered in 2007 did not necessitate psychiatric treatment thereafter. His depression could be due to his unsettled immigration status. There was no “reliable evidence” that he suffered from PTSD; he had presented himself to the psychiatrist with a view to “bolster his claim and to persuade, successfully, that his symptoms show that he suffers from PTSD and depression”. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law because it had overlooked material evidence relevant to the Appellant's credibility: Credibility findings had been made in a vacuum without regard to the evidence of Dr Burman-Roy (the psychiatrist) and Tim Foxley (the country expert) without regard to the former’s evidence that the Appellant’s mental capacity was such that his ability “to give an account of his experiences is likely to fluctuate depending on his circumstances and mental state”; The evidence from Mr Foxley regarding the use of forced recruitment by the Taliban, risks due to being perceived as westernised, intervention of elders and the prevalence of weaponry in Afghanistan, all relevant to the Appellant's account’s plausibility; The psychiatric report from Dr Burman-Roy referred to the likelihood that the Appellant's ability to give an account of his experiences might fluctuate depending on his circumstances, and would be likely to deteriorate if he was acutely distressed, and required attention to be given to his vulnerability as a witness generally. Furthermore, the First-tier Tribunal was said to have erred in law in assessing the risks the Appellant would face on a return because it overlooked The Appellant's PTSD symptoms when assessing the reasonableness of Kabul as an internal relocation alternative, bearing in mind the passages in the Country Guidelines decision (AS Afghanistan) that made clear that mental health was a material consideration; The fact that UNHCR’s eligibility guidelines had materially changed since the decision of the Upper Tribunal in AS and now stated that there was no internal relocation alternative generally available in Kabul; The risks to the Appellant arising from the internal armed conflict, which was particularly relevant given he came from Hesarak district, Nangahar Province. On 2 April 2019 the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal, on the basis that the grounds were arguable; the Mibanga point was thought the strongest one. Ms Cunha accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had committed at least one significant error of law by failing to evaluate the medical evidence before making credibility findings. However, she maintained that this was not a material error of law as the Appellant could not make good his case applying the relevant country guidance, as the psychiatric evidence had not been accepted below, given that the First-tier Tribunal effectively found that the psychiatrist had been fooled by the Appellant, who accordingly fell to be treated as essentially a healthy young man who could thus relocate internally to Kabul. Mr Eaton submitted that the Judge’s findings on the medical evidence were unreliable, given that they were predicated on a rejection of the Appellant's credibility that was itself unsafe. The First-tier Tribunal appeared to have made its own finding on the likelihood of the Appellant having PTSD without properly engaging with the carefully reasoned approach of the medical report. The psychiatrist had found that the Appellant suffered from depression and PTSD such that his evidence should be assessed in the light of the Vulnerable Witnesses Guidance. There were repeated references to mental health in AS Afghanistan as relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness of internal relocation. Decision and reasons I accept that there was an error of law committed by the First-tier Tribunal by leaving the expert evidence out of account prior to making credibility findings. Dr Burman-Roy’s report stated, materially, that the Appellant’s ability to take stock of his position and to integrate in Afghanistan would be affected by increased levels of anxiety, avoidance of challenging situations, and memory and concentration problems; indeed social isolation and self-neglect were common consequences of PTSD; he also stated that “I did not feel that there was any indication Mr [H] was feigning or exaggerating symptoms … Increased levels of anxiety, avoidance of challenging situations and difficulties in memory and concentration are recognised symptoms of PTSD … It was particularly notable that he struggled to maintain focus during the interview and found the process cognitively challenging. I would recommend that [he] be treated as a vulnerable witness …” It was essential for detailed material of this kind to be considered as part of the global assessment of the Appellant’s credibility. Failing so to do was essentially the same error as identified in Mibanga, or as summarised in Virjon B [2002] EWHC 1469 §21, making “adverse findings of credibility with regard to the claimant ... as the means whereby to reject the important and significant evidence [from other sources]. That was putting the cart before the horse.” And as stated in HE [2004] UKIAT 00321 at §22: ""Where the report is specifically relied on as a factor relevant to credibility, the adjudicator should deal with it as an integral part of the findings on credibility rather than just as an add-on, which does not undermine the conclusion to which he would otherwise come."" I also consider that the error was a material one. I cannot accept Ms Cunha’s submission that the First-tier Tribunal’s treatment of the psychiatric evidence was lawful. There was no reference to the Presidential Guidance note on Vulnerable Witnesses. Indeed, the content of the psychiatric report was relied on as a source of discrepancies which were then said to undermine the Appellant's evidence overall. It was essential that the Appellant’s evidence be assessed in the light of that medical evidence, having regard to his potential vulnerability and any effect this might have on the manner in which his evidence presented itself. Dr Burman-Roy had expressly considered, and discounted, the possibility of simulation, and it was essential that express regard be had to that aspect of his account before the Judge came to their own view on the matter. The assessment of the Appellant’s mental health was accordingly unlawful. Were he to be accepted as having mental health problems, then these would have to be assessed in the light of the Guidelines in AS Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 118 (IAC) which cited the EASO Report: “Afghanistan – Key socio-economic indicators, state protection, and mobility in Kabul City, Mazar-e Sharif and Herat City” (August 2017). “142. In terms of mental health care, the same EASO Report recorded very high levels of mental health problems in Afghanistan (particularly depression, anxiety and PTSD) creating significant needs but that there was a lack of trained professionals (psychiatrists, social workers, psychologists) and an inadequate infrastructure. Although the Public Health Minister reported that psychological services were available at some 1,500 health centres around the country with 300 dedicated mental health clinics; there was only one dedicated mental health hospital in Kabul and Samual Hall’s study in 2016 referred to there being only three trained psychiatrists and ten psychologists in the whole of Afghanistan. 143. In Kabul specifically, there is better access to healthcare than in the provinces and the most qualified staff work there with specialist clinics and hospitals; albeit there is still significant room for improvement. There remains a shortage of equipment and demand which outstrips supply. Nearly half of Kabul residents can not afford medical treatment (as patients need to buy their own medicines and, in any event, pharmacies are poorly equipped). There are also instances of health facilities being targeted by armed grounds, including in Kabul.” The Upper Tribunal stated in AS Afghanistan: “234. In our conclusions, we refer throughout to a single male in good health as this is the primary group of people under consideration in this appeal and reflects the position of this particular Appellant. It is uncontroversial that a person who is in good health or fit and able is likely to have better employment prospects, particularly given the availability of low or unskilled jobs involving manual labour in Kabul. We were not provided with any specific evidence of the likely impact of poor physical or mental health on the safety or reasonableness of internal relocation to Kabul but consider it reasonable to infer that this could be relevant to the issue and the specific situation of the individual would need to be carefully considered. … 241. ... (iii) However, the particular circumstances of an individual applicant must be taken into account in the context of conditions in the place of relocation, including a person’s age, nature and quality of support network/connections with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health, and their language, education and vocational skills when determining whether a person falls within the general position set out above.” A further material error of law arose in the light of the UNHCR’s Eligibility Guidelines of 30 August 2018, which state: “Against a background of general concerns about rising poverty levels in Afghanistan, with the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line reportedly having increased from 34 per cent in 2007-2008 to 55 per cent in 2016-2017, the Asia Foundation’s 2017 Survey of the Afghan People found that perceptions of a worsening financial situation was most common in the Central/Kabul region, at 43.9 per cent. In January 2017 it was reported that 55 per cent of households in Kabul informal settlements were severely food insecure. OCHA’s 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview ranks Kabul among the 10 provinces (out of a total of 34 provinces) that are “the most conflict-affected”. In addition, the Humanitarian Needs Overview notes that “needs are particularly pronounced in large urban centres, including Kabul and Jalalabad City, where both IDP and returnee populations have congregated in search of income and livelihoods opportunities as well as access to basic and essential services. Humanitarian needs in these two provinces comprise 42 percent of all those relating to internal displacement and cross-border influxes.” Against the background of the considerations relating to the relevance and reasonableness analysis for Kabul as a proposed area of IFA/IRA, and taking into account the overall situation of conflict and human rights violations, as well as the adverse impact this has on the broader socio-economic context, UNHCR considers that an IFA/IRA is generally not available in Kabul. “ UNHCR occupy an important place in the international community’s approach to refugee status determination. Their views are not determinative, but carry significant weight. The First Tier Tribunal had no regard to the very significant shift in their assessment of the viability of internal relocation to Kabul generally. This was a material error of law. Unfortunately the errors set out above are fundamental one which undermine the entirety of the First-tier Tribunal’s conclusions. Accordingly the matter requires re-hearing, and given the scale of the necessary fact-finding, remittal is appropriate. The Appellant's problems in his home area will require lawful re-assessment in the light of whatever future credibility findings are made on his account. So too will his claim to fear the consequences for civilians of the internal armed conflict in his home area. The First-tier Tribunal will then need to consider whether the Appellant could be reasonably expected to relocate to Kabul, given the psychiatric evidence and the material cited above, and in the light of AS (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 873. Decision The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law and its decision is set aside. The appeal is remitted for re-hearing afresh.

This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 6 February 2019 to allow the appeals of Sangeetha [T], George [P] and [NP], citizens of India, born respectively 19 May 1976, 7 December 1967 and 20 June 2002, those appeals having been brought against the refusal of 28 September 2018 of their human rights claims. 2. The applications to remain on human rights and exceptional grounds giving rise to these proceedings were made on the basis that Sangeetha's leave as Tier 2 migrant had been revoked; she was pursuing reconsideration via the Pre-Action Protocol letter process. Furthermore, she suffered from Tuberculosis diagnosed on 1 August 2018, possibly as a consequence of the aggressive breast cancer she had suffered from since 2013 which had required a mastectomy and monthly hormone treatment via Letrozole and Tamoxifen, scheduled to continue until 2024. [N] was at a crucial stage of his education as he was studying for his A levels. The applications were refused on the basis that the Secretary of State believed that the medical treatment would be available in India, that the medical report indicated her TB was not infectious, and that [N] could transfer his studies to the Indian education system where he could adapt with the support of his parents. 3. The First-tier Tribunal noted the evidence given before it, which included the fact that the Appellant stated she had investigated the cost of hormone treatment in India which came to nearly a thousand pounds a month, which would be beyond the family's means; she and her husband had sold all their assets in India to come to the UK. Sometime after her arrival here she was diagnosed with cancer. Dr Vitta had written a letter of 29 January 2019 recording that Sangeetha had gone through a horrendous experience with her breast cancer, with ongoing treatment and complications, leaving her with complex health needs requiring MDT involvement. 4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the evidence it had received as credible, and considered the appeal under the Immigration Rules, finding that the family would not face very significant obstacles to integration given they had spent their formative years there. However, considering the case outside the Rules, the family was well integrated into British life, spoke English, and were financially independent having never been a burden on the taxpayer. Overall it would be disproportionate to expect them to leave given the virulent breast cancer which required ongoing treatment: this made the case one not of choice but reality. It would be unjustifiably harsh to expect the family to return to India, and it would be appropriate to grant some form of limited leave so as to permit Sangeetha to continue to engage with her medical treatment regime without the treatment break that relocation to India would necessarily entail. 5. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law: (a) In finding the consequences of the family's departure to be unjustifiably harsh notwithstanding having concluded there being no significant obstacles to integrating in India; (b) Accepting the family's evidence absent independent confirmation of the costs of medical treatment in India, and failing to evaluate the availability of alternative medications or to assess the consequences of a change of healthcare regime; (c) In finding that the family had not been a burden on public funds, in failing to take account of Sangeetha's reliance on the National Health Service.6. Permission to appeal was granted on 15 April 2019 by the Upper Tribunal. 7. Before me Ms Cunha explained that the Secretary of State would not pursue the point on the costs of NHS care, on the basis that the husband and wife had paid taxes whilst present lawfully, which represented an appropriate contribution to public funds. However, the Home Office appeal was still pursued, on the basis that inadequate reasons had been given for why it was that the Appellant's return would be unduly harsh, particularly bearing in mind that there was no corroboration of the cost of health treatment. If Sangeetha could access medical treatment financially then she would not face any problems in finding work. 8. Ms Shaw submitted that the Appellant would not be fit to work on a return to India without reliable treatment; and she had given oral evidence of making enquiries in India which had revealed the cost of the injections she needed every 28 days as being a thousand pounds. The Home Office Guidance of 11 April 2019 did not reference medical issues as relevant to the ""very significant obstacles to integration"" question, and thus it was unsurprising that an adverse finding had been made on private life within the Rules but that the appeal nevertheless succeeded outside the Rules, where the health issues had greater resonance. Decision and reasons 9. It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to come to the conclusions which it did. Indeed, its reasoning is unsurprising, and essentially to the effect that it is unjustifiably harsh to expect a woman with serious ongoing cancer problems receiving a course of treatment in the United Kingdom to relocate to India where she would be unable to afford the essential treatment. 10. Ms Cunha was doubtless correct not to pursue the point on the recourse to NHS treatment following the unanticipated development of a serious illness. Migrants lawfully present in the UK will have paid the NHS surcharge as well as contributed towards the country's finances via income and other tax payments. 11. There is no tension between the appeals' success outside the Rules but failure within them. The Rules are only the starting point, albeit that they comprise the embodiment of public policy objectives that combine such that only a ""compelling"" case can succeed outside them. It is clear the First Tier Tribunal was aware of this; indeed it cited and applied the Secretary of State's own preferred term that encapsulates that notion, the ""unjustifiably harsh"" benchmark. 12. As to the ground of appeal challenging the reliance on oral evidence for satisfaction as to the cost of medical treatment, one sees, not infrequently, refusal letters where the Secretary of State puts a fully researched case as to the availability of medical treatment in the country of origin. However, here there is nothing more than a bare assertion that the relevant treatment would be available, with no consideration whatsoever of the impact on the Appellant of the inevitable change in her medical support arrangements or of the question of the affordability of any medication. In those circumstances I do not consider the First-tier Tribunal needed to do more than decide whether it accepted the Appellant's own evidence that she had researched the available medical treatment and would not be able to afford it without working to an extent that would be unrealistic given her state of health. It found that evidence to be credible. That was a conclusion properly open to it. 13. In these circumstances I uphold the decision below. Decision The appeal is dismissed.

Regrettably, the file was mislaid before my decision was perfected, but the decision I provisionally reached has not altered. The file having now been located, I have perfected the decision for promulgation. The Tribunal apologises to the parties for the delay.2. The appellant, who was born in May 1988, is a national of Tunisia. He entered the UK with a spousal visa in August 2013, which visa expired on 22 November 2015. Prior to the expiry of his leave, on 19 November 2015 he applied for further leave to remain on the basis of his family/private life but this was refused on 16 December 2015. The appellant remained in the UK without leave and was served with removal directions as an overstayer in August 2016. A subsequent application for a derivative residence card as a non-EEA family member was refused in May 2017; the appellant was without leave while this application was being considered. 3. On 27 July 2017 the appellant was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and for having an offensive weapon for which he was sentenced to a total of sixteen months' imprisonment. 4. Because of the length of his prison sentence, the appellant was liable to automatic deportation pursuant to Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (subject of course to such deportation not being subject to any of the exceptions set out within Section 33) and accordingly on 26 September 2017 the respondent wrote to the appellant notifying him of the obligation on the respondent to make a deportation order under Section 32(5) of the 2007 Act unless the appellant could demonstrate that one or more of the specified exceptions set out within Section 33 of that Act applied. 5. In response to that letter, the appellant submitted representations on 24 October 2017, in which it was submitted that because of his Article 8 rights his deportation would be in breach of the ECHR. These submissions were considered by the respondent, but in a decision made on 3 May 2018 the respondent rejected the submissions and made a decision refusing the appellant's human rights claim and issuing a deportation order against him. 6. The appellant appealed against this decision but following a hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan sitting at Harmondsworth on 4 October 2018, in a decision promulgated on 22 October 2018 the appellant's appeal was dismissed.7. The appellant now appeals against this decision, permission having been granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaney on 28 November 2018. As Judge Swaney states at paragraph 6 of the reasons for decision, the grant of permission is limited to issues relating to the appellant's Article 8 rights. 8. Prior to the appellant's conviction for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he had (about a month earlier) also been convicted of possession of class A drugs (cocaine), driving without a licence and uninsured and failing to surrender for custody. The basis of his human rights claim was that he had established a family life in the UK because he was in a subsisting relationship with his wife and one son. The respondent noted in the decision letter, however, that the appellant had failed to submit any evidence in support of this claim, beyond stating the names of his family members, which included his son, a British national, born in September 2011. The respondent, within the decision refusing his human rights claim and affirming the decision to deport the appellant, had regard to the respondent's duty to safeguard the welfare of children set out in Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and to the relevant Immigration Rules. However, the respondent did not accept that the appellant had a ""genuine and subsisting parental relationship"" with his son because ""you have provided no evidence to show that you have been in recent contact with him or in a relationship with him prior to or since your imprisonment"". The respondent in this regard noted that:-""A genuine and subsisting relationship means more than a biological relationship and more than presence in a child's life. It requires a significant and meaningful positive involvement in a child's life with a significant degree of responsibility for the child's welfare"".In this regard the respondent noted that the appellant had ""provided no documentation showing joint custody of [his son] with his mother"". 9. The respondent also noted that the appellant was estranged from his son and that there was no evidence to show that he had had any contact with him since his imprisonment. Furthermore, even should he be reconciled with his estranged wife ""it is nevertheless not accepted that it would be unduly harsh for [his son] to join you"". 10. In the alternative, the respondent did not accept that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's son to remain in the UK even if the appellant was deported. The reason given for this conclusion was that the appellant had:-""provided no evidence to show that he [that is the appellant's son] would face any hardship if he were to remain in the UK with his mother when you are deported. He will be able to access all the privileges and benefits granted to him as a British national. He will have his mother as his main carer. He is part of a family unit which includes other extended family members who would support and guide him. In addition he will attend school and continue to build up a network of friends and the support of teachers who would guide him ensuring that he has support with his education.""The respondent also noted that the appellant's son could, if he wished to maintain contact with the appellant, do so ""by using modern means of communication"". 11. With regard to whether or not the exception set out within paragraph 399(b) of the Immigration Rules applied (that is that the foreign criminal had a genuine and subsisting relationship with a British citizen partner which was formed not only when that person's immigration status was not precarious but that it would also be unduly harsh for the foreign criminal's partner to move with the criminal to where the criminal was going to be deported to), first it was not accepted that the appellant was in a subsisting relationship with his wife because the parties were estranged, but in any event it would not be unduly harsh for his wife to live in Tunisia with him.Judge Khan's Decision 12. The judge considered the appellant's relationship with his son under paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules which provides as follows:""399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and(i) the child is a British Citizen; or? and ?(a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the country to which the person is to be deported; and(b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported"".13. This provision mirrors what is set out now in Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which sets out the additional considerations which apply in cases involving foreign criminals as follows:""117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign criminals (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest. (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal. (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies. ?(5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh. ?""14. Judge Khan did not consider that Exception 2 applied with regard to the appellant's relationship with his child because he was not satisfied that the appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with his son. His reasons are set out at paragraph 37 of his Decision:""37. In this case paragraphs [sic] 399 is not engaged, although the appellant has a qualifying, British citizen child residing in the United Kingdom, there is no corroborating evidence before the Tribunal that he has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his son. The appellant's son is 7 years old and resides with his mother. The appellant claimed that he had direct contact with his child before he was sent to prison but there is no independent evidence. He stated that he has indirect contact with his wife by telephone. I find that his claimed contact with his son is also by telephone, on add [sic] hoc basis and not direct contact as he claimed. In the circumstances, I find that paragraph 399 and 229A [again sic, presumably the judge had in mind 399A] exceptional circumstances do not apply in this case"".15. Although the judge then refers to Section 117A and 117B of the 2002 Act, he does not specifically mention 117C, although as already noted above, the statutory provisions within 117C effectively mirror what is set out in paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules, to which the judge did have regard.Grounds of Appeal 16. The grounds are contained in one handwritten page, settled by the appellant in person. It is as follows:""I have lived in the UK since 2013. I have been granted spouse visa from 2013 until 2015. I married to British citizen but we are separated. I got a 7 year's son. He means the world to me. I got a big network to family and friends. I worked and contributed tax like every British taxpayers.""17. The appellant then sets out various Articles of the ECHR on which he presumably relies, being ""Article 2: Right to life and freedom. Article 3: No torture, inhuman or degrading. Article 5: Right to liberty and security. Article 6: Right to a fair trial. Article 7: No punishment without law. Article 8: Right of family and private life"". It is not clear as to what relevance any of the Articles other than Article 8 might have, and as already noted permission to appeal was only granted with regard to arguments founded on the appellant's Article 8 rights. The appellant does not anywhere within his grounds identify any error of law in Judge Khan's decision relied upon. 18. Judge Swaney, when setting out the reasons for granting permission to appeal, states as follows, at paragraph 4:""The judge refers to having carried out a balancing exercise applying the five stage Razgar test. There are however no specific findings made in relation to each stage of that test. Notwithstanding the finding that the appellant had not enjoyed a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his son, the judge accepted some contact was taking place. The parental relationship itself was not in dispute. It is entirely unclear from the decision whether or not the judge accepted that Article 8(1) of the ECHR was engaged and if not, why not. The judge failed to mention the best interests of the appellant's child, much less identify what they are or factor them into the assessment of proportionality"".The Hearing 19. At the hearing before this Tribunal, the appellant, representing himself, expressed his view that he had ""really been punished for my mistake. Sixteen months"". He said he was not an habitual offender and had never been to prison before and wished to continue life as a family member. He had worked and paid tax as any other person. He was separated from his wife, but still in contact and although he had not seen his son since he went to prison, he called him three to four days a week. 20. The appellant told the Tribunal that he wanted an adjournment in order to put in further evidence about the tax that he had paid and the birth certificate of his son, but the Tribunal informed him that he had no need for this because it was accepted that he had paid tax and that his son was British. 21. When asked by the Tribunal as to whether there was anything which made his position more difficult than that of any other person facing deportation, who had a child, he replied that he was being ""double punished"" and that he would appreciate a chance to continue with his life. 22. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Cunha submitted first of all that in order to succeed the appellant had to establish that there were compelling factors which would render his deportation disproportionate because of his Article 8 rights. The judge had considered his son's best interests but had not gone into them in any depth because he had found there was no genuine relationship between the appellant and his British citizen son; at paragraph 19 the judge had noted that he did not have a court order for contact with his son and that he was now separated from his wife, while at paragraph 37 he had noted that there was no corroborating evidence before the Tribunal that the appellant had a genuine subsisting relationship with his son. The judge noted within paragraph 37 that the son was 7 years old and lived with his mother and there was no independent evidence that the appellant had had direct contact with his child before he had been sent to prison as he had claimed. In that paragraph the judge found that his claimed contact with his son was by telephone on an ad hoc basis ""and not direct contact as he claims"". Ms Cunha submitted that this was a finding open to the judge on the evidence before him. 23. So far as the judge's failure to mention Section 117C of the 2002 Act was concerned, this was not a material error because the appellant would still have to establish that the effect of deportation on his son would be ""unduly harsh"". The factors advanced by the appellant clearly did not establish that his deportation would be disproportionate and the judge reached the decision he was bound to reach. 24. In reply, the appellant told the Tribunal that he had stopped his child seeing him in the last two weeks because he did not wish him to see him in the state he was in in prison. Discussion25. Although, as already noted above, Judge Khan did not specifically set out the provisions of Section 117C of the 2002 Act, which are applicable in all cases involving foreign criminals, this was not a material error, as he did have regard to the relevant Immigration Rules, which mirror what is set out within 117C. In particular he had regard to paragraph 399 of the Rules and the circumstances in which that paragraph will apply. By paragraph 398, it is provided that it is in circumstances where that paragraph does not apply that ""the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where there are very compelling circumstances over and above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A"". The judge's reason for considering that paragraph 399 did not apply was that he was not satisfied on the evidence which had been put before him that the appellant had demonstrated that he had a genuine and subsisting relationship with his child. 26. Although another judge on this point might have arrived at a different conclusion and considered that such contact as he had might have amounted to such a genuine and subsisting relationship, there was such little evidence before him that Judge Khan was, in the judgement of this Tribunal, entitled to reach that conclusion.27. No other relationship is relied upon, because his marriage is no longer subsisting, and there is nothing particularly compelling about this appellant's circumstances, absent such relationship as he might have with his child, as could possibly outweigh the very large public interest in deporting foreign criminals. 28. Even if it might just be arguable that the appellant's relationship with his son could be said to amount to family life, on any view it is not a particularly strong one. Any Tribunal now would have to have regard to the recent guidance given by the Supreme Court in KO [2018] UKSC 53, and in particular to what is said within that judgment at paragraph 27 with regard to the meaning of ""unduly harsh"" in the context of the exception provided both within paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules and also within Section 117C of the 2002 Act, whereby, as noted above, it is provided that ""Exception 2 applies where [the foreign criminal] has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of the ""foreign criminals deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh [my emphasis]"".29. At paragraph 27 of KO, the Supreme Court set out with approval the guidance previously given by this Tribunal in MK (Sierra Leone) v SSHD [2015] UKUT 223, where at paragraph 46 a Presidential Tribunal, referring to the ""evaluative assessment"" required of the Tribunal had stated as follows:""By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh' does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard still higher."" 30. On the facts of this case, even taking the appellant's claim at its highest, there was simply no evidence upon which any fact-finding Tribunal could have concluded that the effect of the appellant's removal on his child, who currently does not even see him, could be said to be ""severe"" or ""bleak"" let alone beyond severe or bleak. Understandably, the appellant would like to have a relationship with his son, but his case is no different from that of any other foreign criminals with children who are faced with the prospect of deportation in circumstances where the consequences of their removal is that such relationships as they have with their children will be severely disrupted, or even effectively terminated. As Sedley LJ noted in his well-known dictum in A D Lee, ""that is what deportation does"".31. Having regard to the high threshold which is imposed by the need to establish that the effect on a child will be ""unduly harsh"" there was simply no basis on which Judge Khan or any other judge could have found this threshold was reached on the facts of this case. It follows that his conclusion to this effect was inevitable; there was accordingly no material error of law in his making this finding and dismissing the appeal. The appellant was required to do more than establish that he had some private or family life in this country; he had to establish further either that the effect on his child would be so severe or bleak as could truly be said to be ""unduly harsh"" or that there were factors in his case which were so compelling as to outweigh the large public interest in his deportation. This he has manifestly failed to do. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.32. For the avoidance of doubt, even had I concluded that Judge Khan's decision was sufficiently poorly reasoned that it needed to be remade (which I have not) I would in any event have been obliged when remaking the decision to dismiss the appeal for the reasons I have already given.Decision There being no material error of law in Judge Khan's decision, this appeal is dismissed.No anonymity direction is made.Signed:Upper Tribunal Judge Craig Dated: 23 May 2019",2019-05-31

I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it necessary to do so. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley on 20 March 2019. Thus the case appeared before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law in the decision. Factual background Mr Butt had entered the United Kingdom on 2 April 2006. He had had leave throughout and therefore by December 2016 had accrued 10 years “lawful long residence” in the United Kingdom. During the period that Mr Butt had been in the United Kingdom one of the applications, which he had made, was on 5th August 2010 for leave as a Tier 1 General Migrant. In support of that application the appellant had submitted evidence that his income at that stage was £43,525.88 p from all sources for the period 23 July 2009 to 11 July 2010. The alleged income was made up of £23,093.88 p from Pay As You Earn employment and £23,223 self-employment. [The appears to be some discrepancy in the figures quoted by the respondent. The figures set out add up to £46,316.88 p]. By reason of the income the appellant was awarded 25 points for previous earnings. To be entitled to the points the appellant had to have earnings of between £40,000 - £49,999 for the relevant year. The appellant required 25 points in order to achieve the 80 points necessary to satisfy the rule as a Tier 1 General Migrant. As a result of the declared income Mr Butt achieved the required points and was granted leave as a Tier 1 General Migrant. In response to the present application on 24 May 2017 the SSHD wrote to Mr Butt requiring him to complete a tax questionnaire, part of which required him to either include a tax summary or SA 302s for the years that he had been self-employed. As part of that questionnaire Mr Butt was required to disclose whether or not he had ever needed to correct or resubmit a tax return. Mr Butt accepted that he had had to resubmit a tax return for the period 2009 to 2010 referred to above. He had resubmitted the tax forms in May 2016. The tax returns originally submitted declared a total income for the period in question of £20,156 including £16,768 from PAYE employment and £3388 from self-employment. There was therefore a discrepancy between the income declared to UKVI and to HMRC of over £23,000. If the figure of £20,156 earnings for 2009-10 had been declared to UKVI at the time of making the application referred to above the appellant would have received no points for previous earnings and would not have met the requirements of the rules. Alternatively if the correct figures had been declared to HMRC there would have been an additional tax liability at that time of over £5423.64 p. It appears that on 12 May 2016 the appellant submitted a revised tax calculation for the period 2009-10 showing income received of £40,191 including £16,768 from PAYE employment and £23,423 from self-employment thus reflecting an additional £20,035 from self-employment. There is not only a discrepancy on the self-employment earnings but a discrepancy on the PAYE earnings. In considering the appellant’s application for indefinite leave to remain the respondent relied upon paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules in that the appellant had either submitted a false tax return to HMRC or had submitted false information to UKVI. The approach to be taken with regard to issues arising under paragraph 322(5) have been set out in the cases of R (on the application of Khan) v SSHD (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322 (5)) UKUT 00384 (IAC) and Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673. The case of Khan from paragraph 32 onwards sets out the approach to be taken to assessing whether paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is engaged. Material in that regard is paragraph 33 of the judgement which provides: – “33. It is further the case, in my judgement, that for an applicant simply to blame his or her account for an “error” in relation to the historical tax return will not be the end of the matter. Thus, the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that even where an account has made an error, the account will or should have asked the taxpayer to confirm the return was accurate and to sign the tax return and furthermore the applicant will have known of his or her earnings have expected to pay tax thereon. Thus, in this case the applicant not pay tax of almost £15,000 when he would have expected to do so in the Secretary of State is therefore entitled to ask why, put on notice in this way that something was wrong, the “mistake” had not been remedied earlier.” The case goes on to indicate that whilst an error by an accountant may be a reason for an applicant to show that he was not dishonest but was careless. However in paragraph 34 judgement clearly highlights consideration has to be given whether or not there was a genuine error on the part the account whether this is simply an attempt to pull the wool over their eyes With respect that seems to be the core of the present case. In assessing the present case the judge does not have any explanation from the previous accountant or acceptance that an error had been made and how that error arose. As indicated in the case law the Secretary of State was entitled where there was such a discrepancy to consider that it required an explanation. It was for the appellant to explain how the error arose. Merely blaming the accountant was in the circumstances insufficient. There needed to be evidence as to how the error arose and evidence from the accountant they accepted that the error was theirs. The judge takes into account the approach by HMRC but that of itself does not deal with how the error arose in the alleged firm of accountants nor an acceptance by the firm of accountants that it was their error. Nor does it seek to analyse the circumstances. It seems merely to rely on the fact that HMRC have not imposed any penalty. As identified in the case law there may be many reasons why HMRC do not impose a penalty, none of which impinge upon or reflect a view on their part of the appellant’s behaviour. The judge in the present case appears to be much influenced by his view of why no penalty was imposed by HMRC. It was necessary for the judge to look at how the error arose and whether there was an explanation for the error from the accountants, including correspondence between the accountants and the client to show why the error arose. A mere assertion on the part of the appellant that it was the fault of his accountants was insufficient. That is made plain by the guidance in the cases where it is clear that an individual has to sign and check their tax returns. The caselaw makes clear that some explanation is necessary as to why expecting to may substantially greater tax payments an individual signed tax return which they knew or should know was clearly incorrect. In the circumstances the judge has failed properly to assess the issues in the case specifically those identified the case law. I find that that is a material error of law. The only course is for the matter to be returned to the First-tier Tribunal for a proper assessment to be made of the issues in the case. Notice of Decision I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.

On 7 January 2018 the Secretary of State refused applications made by each claimant for leave to remain in the United Kingdom (UK) on human rights grounds. Each claimant appealed but, on 13 September 2018, the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) dismissed each appeal. A grant of permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal followed and, on 22 March 2019, I decided to set aside the decision of the tribunal, with respect to each appellant, and in doing so, I directed that the decisions be remade by the Upper Tribunal after a further hearing. That hearing took place before me on 8 May 2019. What follows is a setting out of the background circumstances and the issues in these appeals and an explanation as to how I have remade the decisions and why I have done so in the terms in which I have.2. By way of background, all three claimants are nationals of the Philippines. Of those, the person I have called O is an adult female. The person I have called M is an adult male. The two are partners. The person I have called J is the child of O and M. O was born on 21 September 1974. M was born on 18 April 1982. J was born on 11 November 2010. Put simply and briefly, O and M entered the UK in 2009. They had both been given leave to enter for temporary purposes. O had leave to enter until 12 June 2012. M had leave until 30 November 2011. Those respective periods of leave expired but they have remained in the UK without leave thereafter. Prior to the expiry of those periods of leave J was born in the UK. He has lived all of his young life here. He is now receiving education in the UK but he has health and educational difficulties and that has led to the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (which is responsible for his education) putting in place in respect of him an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). On 12 June 2017 O and M sought leave to remain on human rights grounds and a corresponding application was made on behalf of J. Reliance was placed on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It has never been alleged that any of the claimants have any other possible basis of stay in the UK. 3. When matters came before the tribunal on 11 September 2018 it was argued that J, in his particular circumstances, fell within the terms of paragraph 276(ADE)(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules. It was also argued that O and M could rely upon Article 8 of the ECHR outside the Rules bearing in mind in, particular, the content of section 117B (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the need to consider the best interests of a child pursuant to section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. That section creates a duty upon public bodies to safeguard and promote the best interests of children in the UK. So, when making an immigration decision, the Secretary of State must consider the best interests of any child who is in the UK and who is a subject of any such decision. 4. Paragraph 276(ADE) relevantly provides, as follows: ""Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the grounds of private life276(ADE)(1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of application, the applicant?(iv) is under the age of eighteen years and has lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years (discounting any period of imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the UK?"".5. As to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that provides that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest. Of potential importance with respect to the position of the adult claimants in consequence of the position of the child claimant, section 117B(6) provides as follows:6. In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public interest does not require the persons removal where - (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom. 6. It has never been disputed that both O and M have a subsisting parental relationship with J. It was not disputed before me, nor does it seem to have been disputed previously, that J is a ""qualifying child"". That is because although J is not a British citizen he has been in the UK for a period in excess of seven years. 7. With respect to Article 8 either within or outside the Immigration Rules, the burden of establishing entitlement rests upon a claimant. The standard of proof is that of a balance of probabilities. In deciding this appeal with respect to all three claimants, I have had the benefit of all of the documentation which was before the tribunal when it heard the appeal and made its decision. I have had the benefit of further documentation in the form of a bundle filed on behalf of all three claimants, a skeleton argument prepared on their behalf by Mr Waithe, and a document headed ""Directory of Speech Therapy Centers (Philippines only)"" provided by Mr Kotas. The bundle I have just referred to and which was filed on behalf of the claimants contained, amongst other things, a witness statement of O dated 20 April 2019, a witness statement of M also dated 20 April 2019 and an EHCP J dated 12 March 2019. I also had the benefit of hearing oral evidence from O and from M and then oral submissions from Mr Waithe and Mr Kotas. I am grateful to all of those persons. 8. O told me that all of the speech therapy centres referred to in the documents provided by Mr Kotas were in or around Manila which was ten hours away from the province in which O and M had resided in the Philippines in the past and where certain of their family members still resided. O explained that she had previously worked as a teacher in the Philippines and her partner had worked there as a physiotherapist. She has family currently living in the province where she used to live, being her mother (whom she says is elderly and has health problems) and two siblings. M has his parents there too but they are unwell. She thought she would be able to find work as a teacher in the Philippines but doubted that M would be able to find work as a physiotherapist because that profession is not in demand there. But anyway, O's concern, she explained, is not with her position but with that of J. He receives one to one specialist teaching support in the UK. He could not get that in the Philippines. He has speech and language difficulties and mild autism. 9. M gave much briefer evidence, doing no more than adopting his witness statement referred to above. 10. The oral submissions of the representatives followed. In summary, Mr Kotas pointed out that the only real issue for me to decide was whether it would be reasonable to expect J to return to the Philippines. I should adopt the approach set out by the Supreme Court in KO and others v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53. It would be in J's best interests for him to remain in the UK but that is not the same as saying it would not be reasonable to expect him to depart. O and M are from educated backgrounds and would be able to find employment in the Philippines. There are family members there. It does not appear that proper attempts have been made to find out what educational assistance might be available for J in the province of the Philippines to which the family would return if they had to return. Over all, it would be reasonable for them to return. Mr Waithe said he would rely very largely upon the content of his skeleton argument. As to that, the relevant provisions were paragraph 276(ADE)(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules and section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. O and M clearly had parental responsibility for J. It was in J's best interests to remain in the UK. He has severe developmental speech and language disorder and social communication difficulties. He is receiving expert assistance in the UK with respect to that. He is a qualifying child and the public interest does not require the removal of any of the claimants. 11. The representatives are right to say that matters boil down to my assessment of the reasonableness of the return of J in the context of paragraph 276(ADE) of the Immigration Rules and section 117B (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It has not been argued before me that any of the claimants can succeed if the relevant reasonableness tests (or I suppose at least one of them) are met. But the tests are essentially the same and no-one has suggested otherwise in the context of these proceedings. So, it is the question of the reasonableness of J's proposed return which I have focused upon.12. In focusing upon that issue I have had particular regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court in KO, cited above. It is made clear, therein, that misconduct of the parents, in the context of the question of the reasonableness of return of a child, is not directly relevant. In other words, a child is not to be punished for misconduct of the parents by way of, for example, unlawfully overstaying. But it is also said in the judgment that the conduct of parents can have indirect relevance to an assessment of reasonableness in the relatively limited sense that it will normally be reasonable for a child to be with the parents and if the parents, through their record, cease to have a right to remain in the UK and have to leave, it might be thought that it would at least sometimes be reasonable for the child to leave in order to stay with those parents (see paragraph 18 of the judgment in KO). 13. Having reminded myself of what was said in KO and the content of the tests in statute and within the Immigration Rules which I have set out above, it is necessary for me to make findings of fact concerning the position of J. The particular concern which has been stressed and relied upon on his behalf and therefore on behalf of O and M, is his educational or developmental difficulties. 14. There was evidence of such difficulties when it heard the appeal and I have that documentary evidence in front of me. But I also have more up to date evidence in the most recent claimant bundle including, as I have said, the EHCP of 3 March 2019. That is a helpful document. It seems to me to give a good flavour of J's difficulties which is, of course, what one might expect. It confirms he has ""a diagnosis of developmental speech and language disorder and social communication difficulties"". It also refers to his having cognitive difficulties. It is said that his social communication difficulties ""may be suggestive of autism spectrum disorder"" though it also suggests that they might be secondary to his speech and language disorder. Reference is made to his expressive language difficulties being severe. It is said that he has difficulty communicating with and interacting with his peers. It is noted that he attends a mainstream school setting but receives twenty hours of one to one educational support each week in addition to some speech and language therapy. There was some discussion before me as to whether there was or was not a clear diagnosis with respect to autism spectrum disorder. It seems to me that there is not, although there are indications that he might or very likely does have such a disorder. I have not found it necessary to make a precise finding as to diagnosis. It seems to me sufficient for me to decide that he has difficulties of substance which are mirrored in the quite considerable provision of twenty hours of one to one educational support each week.15. J would, of course, if he were to return to the Philippines, do so with his parents. I accept Mr Kotas submission to the effect that O and M are from a professional background and have experience or qualifications which would aid them in finding work in the Philippines. I see no reason to disbelieve O when she tells me that M's profession is not in any particular demand in the Philippines. But she acknowledged that she would be able to obtain work and I find that, given time, both would have good prospects of finding employment in their respective fields (or perhaps ij the case of M in another field which may be linked to the area in which he has professional qualifications) such that they would be able to cater for themselves and for J. Indeed such did not seem to be seriously disputed.16. O gave evidence regarding the presence of various family members not only in the Philippines but also in the particular province to which it appears they would return if they had to return to the Philippines. She sought to stress that some of them are elderly and not in good health but there is no corroborative evidence of that. She did not refer to any specific medical conditions from which any of those family members suffer. I find on the material before me that of the relatives she mentioned in her evidence (see above) certain of them might not be in the best of health but any health problems there are, are not of real significance. I find that the family members that there are in the Philippines would be able to welcome J to that country and assist him, at least to an extent, with respect to any emotional difficulties and adjustments he might experience in settling to life there. 17. I have not been provided with very much in the way of evidence as to what provision might be available for J with respect to his educational and developmental difficulties if he has to return to the Philippines. The document produced by Mr Kotas at the hearing indicated the availability of some provision. O told me, in oral evidence, that the provision referred to was in a location far away from where she, M and J would go to live if returned. She also said that such was not provided free of charge. But in cross examination she also acknowledged that as to provision in the province to which she would return, she had simply assumed that nothing would be available without undertaking full research on the point. I have done my best to reach findings on the material before me but can do no better than to conclude that the evidence does not preclude the possibility that some degree of support, though I accept it is very unlikely to be of the level J is currently receiving, might be available in the Philippines. 18. My having set out my relevant factual findings together with the import of the judgment in KO and the relevant legal provisions, I must now consider whether it would or would not be reasonable for J to return to the Philippines. My conclusion, it seems to me, would inevitably be the same with respect to the test within the Immigration Rules set out above and the test within the statute set out above. 19. As I have indicated, it is accepted that J is a qualifying child. It is accepted (or at least it has never been disputed at all) that M and O have a subsisting parental relationship with J. But those matters, of themselves, are not sufficient to mean the appeals succeed. The question, as I have already said, is one of reasonableness. 20. Neither M nor O have an independent right to be in the UK other than through their connections with J. Ordinarily, therefore, they would be expected to return to the Philippines.21. J does have substantial difficulties as set out above. He is receiving a package of care and educational assistance in the UK which in my view is substantial. The nature of his particular difficulties (although this point was not made in terms) seem to me to be likely to make his resettlement in a country which he is not familiar with, his never having lived there, to be even more difficult than would otherwise be the case. It is understandable that his parents wish him to remain here to continue to receive that package of support. But in the Philippines he would at least have support from his parents and wider family. He would be in an environment where those immediately caring for him would be familiar with the culture and lifestyle. It has not been asserted that the family would have a life of poverty in the Philippines and I have found that M and O would have good prospects of finding employment. O tells me that she has no training or experience with respect to children with special educational needs and there is no reason why I should disbelieve her as to that. But as a teacher she might be able to assist J with his difficulties at least a little more than other parents in a different profession might be able to do.22. In light of the above I do accept, as Mr Kotas in fact very fairly concedes, that it would be in the best interests of J to remain in the UK with both of his parents. But I also accept that a conclusion as to best interests, whilst it informs it, does not dictate the outcome with respect to an assessment as to the reasonableness of return for a child. In returning J will lose a great deal through his disconnection with the UK educational and health system. He has lived here all his young life. But I am dealing with matters in a context where there is an expectation that his parents should leave. The natural expectation following that is that he would go with them and I have concluded that requiring him to do so would, in all the circumstances, be reasonable. In so deciding I have taken account of the support he will receive from parents and other family and his parents' familiarity with life in the country to which they will be returning. That means that J does not himself succeed under paragraph 276(ADE)(1)(iv) and his parents do not succeed in an Article 8 assessment outside the rules on the basis of section 117B(6). It has not been argued that there is any other basis upon which any of them might succeed. Accordingly, in remaking the decision with respect to all three claimants, I dismiss their respective appeals from the decisions of the Secretary of State, made with respect to each of them, on 7 January 2018. 23. I have granted anonymity to each claimant. I was asked to do so by Mr Waithe in order to protect the privacy of J who is, of course, a minor child. Mr Kotas did not oppose a grant of anonymity. DecisionThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with respect to each claimant, has already been set aside. In remaking the decisions with respect to each claimant, I dismiss their appeals from decisions of the Secretary of State of 7 January 2018. AnonymityI grant each claimant anonymity pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Accordingly, no report of these proceedings shall name or otherwise identify any of the three claimants or any family member. The grant of anonymity applies to all parties to the proceedings. Failure to comply may lead to contempt of court proceedings. To the Respondent: Fee AwardI make no fee award. Signed: Dated: 28 May 2019Upper Tribunal Judge Hemingway",2019-05-31
23,HU/01695/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: HU/01695/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 17 May 2019 On 31 May 2019      Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MONSON Between MISS AFIA AFIA (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE) Appellant and ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr Gilbert, Counsel instructed by Rahman & Company Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS The appellant has been granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bowler sitting at Hatton Cross on 14 December 2018) dismissing her appeal against the decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance for the purposes of settlement as a child under the age of 18 of a person present and settled here. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the appellant requires anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal. The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal On 29 March 2019 First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted the appellant permission to appeal as it was arguable, in the light of what was accepted by the Respondent, that the Judge had not applied the correct criteria under Rule 297. Relevant Background The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 28 December 2018. Just before her 18th birthday, she applied for entry clearance to join her mother in the UK. She presented documents to show her father had died on 14 December 2009. On 27 October 2017 an Entry Clearance Officer gave his reasons for refusing her application by reference to Rule 297. He accepted that her mother was her sole surviving parent. But he was not satisfied that her mother had had sole responsibility for her upbringing; or alternatively that the criteria in Rule 297(i)(f) were satisfied. In addition, he was not satisfied that there would be adequate maintenance and accommodation for her and her mother without recourse to public funds, having regard to the guidance given in Ahmed (Benefits; Proof of Receipt: Evidence) Bangladesh [2013] UKUT 84 (IAC). The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal There was no legal representation for the appellant at the hearing before Judge Bowler. The Judge received oral evidence from the Sponsor. In his subsequent decision, Judge Bowler found that the Sponsor was exercising very little responsibility for the appellant; and that her welfare was not prejudiced by her current living arrangements. The Judge then turned to consider an Article 8 claim outside the Rules. He observed that the Sponsor’s wages of less than £1,350 per month gross as shown by the payslips totalled £16,200, which was less than the figure of £18,600 per annum which was “generally applied as a financial requirement”. Alternatively, the appellant had not shown that her mother’s wages were sufficient to maintain and accommodate her and her mother without recourse to public funds, “especially as the rent is stated to be for a one bedroom flat”. The Judge went on to conclude that the interference with family and private life consequential on the maintenance of the refusal decision was proportionate. The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was made out, Mr Gilbert briefly developed the appellant’s case. Mr Tarlow conceded that the Judge had materially erred in law in not considering the application of Rule 297(i)(d). I accepted Mr Tarlow’s concession, and held that an error of law was made out. My reasons for so finding are set out below. For the purposes of remaking the decision, I sought clarification from Mr Tarlow as to his position on the maintenance and accommodation requirements. He said that he was not challenging the documentary evidence on this issue that had been contained in the appellant’s bundle for the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal. He made it clear that he was content that the decision should be remade in the appellant’s favour. Reasons for Finding an Error of Law Rule 297 provides that the requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled, or being admitted for settlement into the United Kingdom, are that he: (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent, parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances: … (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and the other parent is dead (my emphasis); or (e) one parent is settled in the United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had sole responsibility for the child’s upbringing; or (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and there are serious and compelling family or other considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made for the child’s care; and (ii) is under the age of 18; and (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a civil partner, and is not from an independent family unit; and (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the parent, parents or relative the child is seeking to join without recourse to public funds in accommodation which the parent, parents or relative of the child is seeking to join, own or occupy exclusively; and (v) can, and will be maintained adequately by the parent, parents or relative of the child is seeking to join, without recourse to public funds; and (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity; and (viii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for the refusal. The Judge gave adequate reasons for finding that the appellant did not satisfy the gateway requirement of sole responsibility or the gateway requirement of there being serious and compelling family or other considerations which made her exclusion undesirable. However, he failed to address the question of whether the appellant qualified for entry clearance on the simple basis that her father was dead. Even though the point had not been taken by the appellant – which was understandable, as she was not legally represented – it was a “Robinson obvious” point which needed to be addressed, as it was accepted in the RFRL that the appellant’s father was dead and that the Sponsor was her sole surviving parent. The Judge also erred in not giving adequate reasons for finding that the appellant did not meet the requirements of Rules 297(iv) and (v). The reasoning which underpinned the Judge’s negative findings under Rules 297(iv) and (v) was that the evidence as to the Sponsor’s income and the amount of rent she was paying each month only consisted of a “simple statement” to this effect. But this was not true. The bundle of documents filed for the hearing contained a Tenancy Agreement showing that the Sponsor was paying £500 per month and the following sources of evidence for the Sponsor’s earnings and disposable income: a P60, a series of wage slips, money transfer receipts, and an employment letter from Sun Foods Ltd. The Judge also appears to have assumed that a one bedroom flat will be inherently unsuitable to accommodate the appellant as well as her mother, although this was not a point taken in the RFRL. As pleaded in the permission application, under the Housing Act 1985 there will not be statutory over-crowding where two adults share a one bedroom flat. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law such that it must be set aside and remade. Discussion and Findings on Remaking It is accepted in the RFRL that the appellant’s father is dead. Accordingly, the appellant is able to bring herself within Rule 297(i)(d) as her mother is present and settled in the United Kingdom, and “the other parent is dead”. It appears to have been the view of the Entry Clearance Officer who refused the application that the death of the father was not the reason why the appellant was seeking entry clearance just before her 18th birthday, which is probably true, and that therefore his death was irrelevant to the question of the appellant’s ability to bring herself within the scope of Rule 297 (i). But this approach was misconceived. The appellant was not required to justify her motivation. All that the Rule requires is that one of the set of circumstances set out in sub-paragraph (i) applies. The appellant was applying in circumstances where one parent was settled in the UK, and the other parent was dead. That was all that the appellant needed to prove. The Entry Clearance Officer put in issue the Sponsor’s ability to maintain and accommodate the appellant adequately without recourse to public funds, due to the paucity of the supporting documents provided with the application. As Mr Tarlow accepts, the appellant has adequately addressed this concern by filing the documents which I have listed in [13] above. It is common ground that the appellant does not need to meet the MIR. She has provided sufficient evidence to show that her mother’s net income comfortably exceeds the rent she has to pay each month, and that, after taking into account additional outgoings such as utility bills, there is still likely to a be a substantial surplus in the mother’s disposal income so as to enable her to maintain and accommodate her daughter adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds. As all the relevant requirements of Rule 297 are met, the question of proportionality does not arise. The appellant has made out her case that the decision to refuse her human rights claim by reference to Rule 297 is unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

For the Respondent: Mr Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.DETERMINATION AND REASONS1. The appellant, Mr Tomas Vilkas, is a national of Lithuania. He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision made by the Secretary of State on 18 January 2018 to make a deportation order against him. The decision is, because of his nationality, taken under the provisions of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016. The regulation particularly relevant to the decision is Reg 27(5) which I do not need to set out: it was set out in full by the judge who dealt with his appeal and the grounds of appeal before me do not specifically relate to the judge's application of that regulation. 2. The appeal was heard on 12 February 2019 by Judge Gillespie in Belfast. He dismissed the appeal. The grounds of appeal are that it was unfair for the judge to deal with the appeal on that occasion. Two issues are raised. The first is that it was wrong in law for the judge to proceed to deal with and determine a deportation appeal when there were extradition proceedings outstanding in relation to the appellant, as indeed there were, and which I shall refer to in a moment. The second ground is that it was unfair for the judge to proceed because the appellant was represented newly by a firm of solicitors who had not had proper time to take instructions. 3. So far as the extradition is concerned, the position is as follows. Extradition proceedings have been taken under a European arrest warrant in relation to this individual and a number of others from Lithuania. The Northern Ireland court system has before it a number of appeals against the extradition proceedings by Lithuanian nationals of whom the appellant is one. They are being dealt with by Her Honour Judge Smith in Belfast; she has so far issued two intermediate judgments. The first sought specific undertakings or indicated that certain undertakings would need to be given by the Lithuanian government in relation to prison conditions in Lithuania. The second seeks specific undertakings. I am told by Mr McTaggart who appears on behalf of the appellant before me that the last set of undertakings have not, at present been given. Thus, so far as the extradition proceedings are concerned, they are outstanding before the Northern Ireland judicial system. There is the possibility of a judicial review of Judge Smith's decision when it is eventually given but the extradition proceedings have to be regarded as in progress and currently undetermined for the purposes of the proceedings in this Tribunal. Those proceedings raise, of course, different matters from those to be considered by the Upper Tribunal. Nevertheless, if the challenge to the extradition proceedings is successful it is unlikely that the appellant could properly be removed to Lithuania. If, however, the challenge is unsuccessful, the appellant might be able to resist removal to Lithuania on the basis of matters relating to his own circumstances. 4. Why are there extradition proceedings raised by Lithuania? The position is as follows; and in looking at that issue I shall try and summarise the little that is known of the appellant and his movements. He was in Lithuania on 26 October 2012 - that is the last date given by him in oral evidence before the judge, on which he was convicted of an offence in Lithuania. It appears that on that occasion he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Lithuania of, in total, four years. However, by December 2012, two months later he is recorded as entering the United Kingdom. Nothing else is known about that entry other than its approximate date. It was, however, evidently very shortly after his sentence in Lithuania and the position appears to be that he managed to escape prison in Lithuania in order to come to the United Kingdom on that date. Nothing then appears to be known about him until there were proceedings in the Republic of Ireland for his extradition to Lithuania. I know little about the date of those proceedings other than that they continued for some time in the Republic, going as far as the Supreme Court, which then made a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Communities; and thereafter the final decision by the Supreme Court of the Republic was issued on 5 December 2018. 5. Those proceedings were also extradition proceedings raised by the government of Lithuania. I do not know, and Mr McTaggart has not told me, the circumstances under which the appellant was in the Republic of Ireland during the course of those proceedings. However, it is apparent that if there were any provisions restricting his movement, he probably breached them because on 11 April 2017 he was in the United Kingdom. We know that because on that date he was arrested for possession of false documents, which he said later that he obtained in order to work in the United Kingdom. On 20 April an extradition warrant was signed against him in relation to his extradition from the United Kingdom. He has, I understand it, been in custody ever since. The false documents offence was dealt with by a separate suspended sentence. 6. So far as his presence in the United Kingdom is concerned, therefore, all that is known is that he was here for at least part of one day in December 2012 and that he was here on 11 April 2017. There is, so far as Mr McTaggart has been able to tell me, no other evidence of his presence in the United Kingdom except in custody. His criminal record shows, apart from the offences in Lithuania, apparently a breach of the Republic's conditions, under which he was kept pending his extradition proceedings there; and false documentation in the United Kingdom. There is also what appears to be a persistent difficulty in that he does not receive, or claims not to have received, official notices sent to him in custody: that indeed is part of the history of the proceedings before Judge Gillespie in relation to the appeal. 7. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned however, he has been throughout, in what may be called a rather intermittent way, he has been represented by solicitors. The position is that the deportation proceedings with which Judge Gillespie was concerned were originally listed for hearing in July 2018. At that time Mr McTaggart, who appears before me today representing him, sought an adjournment: on that occasion Mr Vilkas was represented by Rafferty and Donaghy Solicitors. There were further hearings, and as I have said some of them were affected by claims that notices had not arrived. When the hearing was listed for 12 February 2019 a Notice of Hearing was sent on 2 November 2018 to the appellant in custody; the appellant claimed that he had not received that. There was then also a letter of 8 January 2019 to the Governor of the prison. The appellant nevertheless, as I understand it, complained on 12 February 2019 that he had no idea that he had an appeal hearing. 8. What also happened was that the solicitor at Rafferty & Donaghy who had been representing him, a Mr Ruairi Maguire, had moved firms to McCourt and Maguire and had become indeed a principal in that firm (as perhaps its name reflects). On Friday 8 February, it is said the appellant instructed McCourt and Maguire. On 12 February, the following Tuesday, Mr McCourt of that firm appeared before Judge Gillespie and sought an adjournment apparently solely on the basis that he had not had time properly to prepare. I say 'apparently solely on that basis' because there has been no evidence before this Tribunal which might supplement what is in the judge's decision. What is in the judge's decision is an account of Mr McCourt's indication that he had not had time to prepare, followed by ""Mr McCourt requested an adjournment."" The judge indicated that he was satisfied that the Notices of Hearing had been properly served and that the history of the proceedings indicated that it was now right to proceed. 9. Mr McCourt's further contributions appear to have been limited to indicating with some brevity the progress of the extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and also saying that he would not continue with the hearing as he did not have sufficient material to enable him to do so. 10. The appellant therefore presented his case in person and was able to tell the judge about his own perception of the proceedings against him and about his own personal life; and the facts that I have already related in relation to his movements from Lithuania to the United Kingdom, from the United Kingdom to the Republic, and from the Republic back to the United Kingdom are derived from what he told the judge on that occasion. 11. It is, I think, convenient to deal first with the second ground, that is to say, the unfairness of proceeding, separated for the moment from the issue as to extradition, although in the grounds of appeal it is asserted that the second ground really interacts with the first. As I have said, there has been no evidence in relation to the appeal to this Tribunal. Of what happened before the judge I am limited to what is found in the judge's decision, and indeed Mr McTaggart did not suggest that I should go outside that decision for consideration of these issues. The judge was aware of the extradition proceedings. He was made further aware of them by Mr McCourt's brief submission about them. He was essentially being asked however, to adjourn, not because there was an argument that in law he should not proceed because of the pending expedition proceedings, but because the solicitor had not had time to prepare the case. 12. It seems to me that the judge was wholly entitled to reach the view he did on the history as he knew it. This was not a case where the appellant was taken by surprise in the sense of needing to prepare a case. He had, after all already prepared a case in a different country, and had had in the circumstances of the present appeal ample time to get the material together. He had been represented for a considerable length of time by a solicitor who was now a member of the very firm of solicitors who had been recently instructed and who said they had not had time to represent him. But even if Mr McCourt had only heard on 8 February that he was instructed, there was still time to do more than he appears to have been able to do, which is to say that he wrote on 11 February, three days later (I accept that there is a weekend but it is three days later) to Mr McGuire's old firm seeking the papers. There cannot have been any realistic prospect that that was acting quickly enough for a hearing, which following earlier adjournments, was to take place on the Tuesday. It seems to me that if the appellant's appointed solicitors knew little about the case on 12 February then that is a matter which was not primarily one for the judge to do other than make a decision about. It was not one which ought to have caused the judge to think that it would be unfair to proceed. The lack of knowledge was `the result of a combination of the appellant's and his solicitors' conduct over many months previously. 13. For that reason, I regard Ground 2 as not made out.14. I turn then to ground 1, which is the ground that it was wrong to proceed on the basis that the extradition proceedings were outstanding. As I have said, the extradition proceedings relate to different issues and different considerations; and the outcome of the extradition proceedings might have an effect of the eventual fate of the appellant. But there are a number of other factors to bear in mind, of which the crucial one is that noted by the judge: that the matters were different; and further that this was a case where, although on 12 February 2019, the date of the hearing, the appellant was represented, the point that an adjournment should be granted because of the continuing extradition proceedings does not appear to have been specifically made: as I have indicated, the only ground for the adjournment appears to have been Mr McCourt's ignorance of the case. Under those circumstances it appears to me that there is no proper basis for saying that this judge should not have proceeded. He dealt with the issues before him, in circumstances where, although the appellant was represented by a solicitor, it was not agreed that it would be wrong in law for him to proceed. For those reasons I reject Ground 1.15. That means that my judgment is that the Ground fails and it follows that the determination dismissing the appeal should stand. Mr McTaggart has been anxious to say that I ought to be concerned with the appellant rather than his solicitors. That is quite a difficult argument to make, bearing in mind that the appellant was represented by solicitors and unless a judge has taken the view that the solicitors are incompetent, the judge probably ought to deal with the case as presented by the solicitors. In any event, what is the real position?16. The judge, as I have said, applied Reg. 27(5); he noted the appellant's criminal convictions; he noted his lack of any real evidence of presence in the United Kingdom other than in custody. He had to determine whether the decision of the Secretary of State complied with the principle of proportionality; was based exclusively on the personal conduct of the appellant; and whether that personal conduct represented a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, taking into account his past conduct and that the threat does not need to be imminent. It seems to me that the judge dealt with those factors properly in paragraph 35 in particular of his decision, and as I have said there is no specific challenge to the merits of the judge's decision. 17. So far as matters which might go to proportionality are concerned, the position is that the appellant has, as I have indicated, failed to show that he was in the United Kingdom, other than in custody, except on one day in 2012 and one day in 2017. On the occasion in 2017 he appears to have been working but the work was evidently unlawful and was supported by unlawful documentation. He has been in custody in the United Kingdom for a considerable period of time, I assume he has also been in custody in the Republic. 18. In the United Kingdom it is said that he has a mother and perhaps some siblings (in Great Britain, not in Ireland) and that his mother has visited him in prison. There are no details of that. As I indicated to Mr McTaggart the matters that can be adduced on his side going to the proportionality of the decision are laughably inadequate. The judge was right to consider that there was really nothing to be weighed on the appellant's side in that respect. 19. There is a further issue, however, raised by Mr McTaggart today, but not so far as I can see at any stage raised in the appeal proceedings previously, which is precisely the issue which is raised in the deportation proceedings: that is to say that prison conditions in Lithuania to which he will have to return if he is removed or extradited are a breach of article 3 and possibly of article 8. That is a matter which has not been argued in the deportation proceedings. It would have been a new matter before Judge Gillespie if it had been argued. There seems no reason to suppose that bearing in mind the continuation of the extradition proceedings the Secretary of State would have consented for Judge Gillespie to deal with it. If the outcome of the extradition proceedings merits it, no doubt further issues along those lines may be raised by the appellant in due course; but as I have said they are not part of these proceedings. So far as these proceedings are concerned it seems to me that not merely is the decision to dismiss this appeal the right one on the grounds, but that looking at the merits in the way that I have done it is difficult to see that any injustice is suffered by the appellant by a determination to that effect. 20. I therefore dismiss the appeal and order that Judge Gillespie's decision shall stand. C. M. G. OCKELTONVICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNALIMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBERDate: 21 May 2019",2019-05-31
25,PA/13434/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/13434/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Manchester Decision and Reasons Promulgated On 1st May 2019 On 30th May 2019 Before DEPUTY JUDGE UPPER TRIBUNAL FARRELLY Between M F K (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE) Appellant And SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the appellant: Miss G Patel, Counsel, instructed by Broudie Jackson and Canter (Dale House) For the respondent: Mr A Tan, Senior Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS The appellant is a national of Pakistan. He came to the United Kingdom with leave as a student in September 2009. Thereafter, he made various applications. He was granted further leave to remain as a student until October 2014.Subsequent applications were unsuccessful. The last of these was refused in August 2015. Then, in September 2015, he made a claim for protection. That claim was refused on 12 November 2018. His appeal against that decision was unsuccessful. The basis of his claim is his relationship with a Mrs K. Mrs K is also from Pakistan and came here as a student. Her husband remained in Pakistan. She made an earlier claim for protection similar to the appellant’s which was refused and dismissed on appeal. She and the appellant now have 3 children; [M], born in March 2012, [Z], born in January 2016 and [A], born in 24 March 2017. The appellant claims to fear not only his own family but also the family of Mrs K. In refusing his claim the respondent did not accept he had established a real risk from either family. His credibility was questioned and reliance was placed upon section 8 of the 2004 Act. If the claim were true then the respondent concluded there would be sufficiency of protection for him and he could relocate. Reference was made to the best interests of the children and the conclusion was it would be best served by return to Pakistan with both parents. The appellant’s appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies at Manchester on 2 January 2019. In a decision promulgated on 18 January 2018 it was dismissed. The Upper Tribunal Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted on the basis it was arguable the judge was wrong to consider himself bound by the findings made in the decision of Mrs K. Her appeal was heard in Manchester before First-tier Judge De Haney and dismissed in a decision promulgated on 3 June 2015.It was also argued that the judge failed to give adequate reasons behind the decision. First-tier Judge De Haney had found that Mrs K was in fact divorced from her husband in Pakistan, something she denied. The judge also found that she had married this appellant in an Islamic marriage ceremony in the United Kingdom. The judge had also found that her family were supportive of the relationship between Mrs K and the appellant. First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies heard from the appellant and Mrs K. The judge did not find either credible. The judge said: 68.I have paid particular regard to the findings made by Immigration Judge De Haney in his decision promulgated on 3 June 2015… I have taken into account the evidence of the appellant’s partner in that regard but I am satisfied to the lower standard that her evidence commenting on Immigration Judge De Haney’s findings is as he concluded fabricated I take into account that this appeal hearing is not an appeal against the findings made by Immigration Judge De Haney. No evidence had been put before me to suggest that Immigration Judge De Haney’s decision was successfully appealed against and therefore I am bound by the clear and cogent findings made… 70. The evidence before me indicates that the Appellant and his partner are indeed husband and wife having gone through an Islamic marriage ceremony. Therefore their children are not children who have been born outside wedlock. I therefore conclude that the Appellant’s claim to be in need of international protection is wholly without merit. Miss Patel relied on the grounds of appeal and the grant of permission. She said this was not a Devaseelan situation and even if it were, the earlier decision is the starting point not the end of the matter. She also argued that the reasoning behind the decision was inadequate. She referred me to paragraph 69 when the judge stated without further reasoning `The Appellant’s partner’s evidence as to why she had stated she was married to the appellant previously is wholly without credibility’. Miss Patel submitted the judge did not properly consider the evidence of the appellant. An explanation had been given as to why the families were told of the relationship and this was not considered. She referred to the threatening text messages which prompted the claim. It was argued in the alternative that the family could relocate within Pakistan. However, she submitted their location would be revealed through the presence of their children and the judge had not considered this. Mr Tan opposed the appeal and referred me to paragraph 29 where the judge refers to taking all the evidence into account, including the decision of First-tier Immigration Judge De Haney. I was referred to the cross-examination of the appellant at paragraph 34 and 35. He adopted the rule 24 response which cited the decision of Ocampo which at paragraph 24 said: “… Re- litigation of issues which have already been resolved is contrary to the public interest, and nothing in the process suggest that the first application should or must automatically be treated as irrelevant to second applications…” At paragraph 71 the judge gave an explanation for rejecting the explanation given as to why their families were told. He submitted in the circumstances it was not necessary to set out findings in detail. At paragraph 74 the judge had referred to the documents produced and having concluded if they were married there was no logical basis behind the claimed threats. Regarding the question of relocation, he submitted that no evidence has been led as to how the family could be traced through the children. In response, Miss Patel referred me back to paragraph 68 where the judge referred to being ‘bound’ by the previous decision. She accepted that if the judge had said the previous decision was the starting point that the challenge would fall away. She said that the 2 grounds upon which permission was granted were in the alternative. She said the judge did not properly consider the evidence or the witness statements of the parties. Rather, the judge made the bare assertion about them being married. Consideration First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies was presented with a bundle on behalf of the appellant for the appeal. This contains detailed statements from the appellant and Ms K. The statements seek to refute the conclusion that Ms K is divorced from her husband and has married the appellant. In her statement she details her visit Visa appeal and seeks to explain why she had told her lawyer she was divorced. The bundle contains the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney. That decision records Mrs K’s account whereby she said she came to the United Kingdom in September 2004 and then returned to Pakistan in 2006 to marry. She stated she then returned to the United Kingdom to finish her studies, returning to Pakistan the following year. There is reference to her wanting to be divorced from her husband but claiming her family would not allow this. She then came back to the United Kingdom in March 2011.She then gave birth to her 1st child by the appellant in March 2012. There was a further pregnancy in November 2013 but the child was stillborn in July 2014. They now have 2 other children. Reference was made to an earlier student Visa appeal where she stated she had married the appellant in an Islamic ceremony in July 2011. There was reference to a witness statement in that earlier appeal in which she refers to an Islamic marriage to the appellant. Before Judge De Haney she denied such a marriage took place, stating she had lied in her statement and before that tribunal. Judge De Haney concluded that Mrs K was not a witness to the truth. At paragraph 26 judge concluded that when she returned to the United Kingdom in 2011 she was divorced from her husband and subsequently married the appellant. Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 00702 gave guidance on the extent an adjudicator in an appeal based solely on human rights grounds should rely on finding made in a previous determination dealing with an asylum claim. The case arose because following an unsuccessful asylum claim a further claim could be made that removal would breach the persons human rights. The guidance given was that the first Adjudicator's determination should always be the starting-point. Facts happening since the first Adjudicator's determination can always be taken into account by the second Adjudicator. If before the second Adjudicator the Appellant relies on facts that are not materially different from those put to the first Adjudicator the second Adjudicator should regard the issues as settled by the first Adjudicator's determination and make his findings in line with that determination rather than allowing the matter to be re-litigated. The present situation is different in that the appeal before First-tier Tribunal judge De Haney concerned Mrs K rather than this appellant. Furthermore, the appeal was heard in May 2015 and the present appeal in January 2019.Nevertheless, the same central issue arose in both appeals, namely, the marital status between the parties. Between the 2 appeals Mrs K had further children. In the 2nd appeal both parties gave evidence and there was an appeal bundle provided. So far as a core issue was concern there was little by way of new evidence. In Ocampo v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1276 it was pointed out it was doubted that the principles of res judicata or issue estoppel have any application, certainly in their full rigour, to appeals before immigration tribunals. However, the Devaseelan guidelines are relevant to cases where the parties involved are not the same but there is a material overlap of evidence. This clearly is the situation here. It is highly desirable that there is consistency between judicial decisions on the same issue. There may be good reasons for different outcomes. For instance, evidence may have been produced in the 2nd appeal which provides a basis for not following the outcome of the 1st. There may have been changes in the interval. In the present appeal although the judge refers at paragraph 68 to being bound by the previous decision I find the judge did not mean this literally. Had the judge adopted this approach there would have been no need to have set out all the details given in the decision. At paragraph 29 the judge referred to the evidence at hearing and the submissions whilst commenting that the earlier decision was particularly pertinent. Given the common issue this is really an obvious point. However, the approach of the representative indicated that the relationship between the appellant and Mrs K was in dispute at that hearing. Both were cross-examined about their relationship. Notably, in the 1st appeal this appellant did not give evidence and there was reference to a breakdown in the relationship turned out to be temporary. First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies had the benefit of hearing from both. At paragraph 38 he records that the appellant was asked if Mrs K had tried to obtain a divorce from her husband. He did not answer questions about this until the judge reminded him of the nature of the proceedings, as set out at paragraph 31.the judge had a detailed statement from Mrs K where she sought to reargue the conclusion made by First-tier Tribunal judge De Haney. First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies at paragraph 68 indicated he was having particular regard to the findings made by First-tier Tribunal judge De Haney. Given the common issues arising and the evidence upon which the earlier decision was made this was an obvious thing to do. The judge refers to taking into account the explanation provided by Mrs K but rejected it. At paragraph 70 the judge referred to the evidence before him. Clearly therefore the judge is not simply adopting the earlier decision but is looking at all the evidence presented. At paragraph 74 the judge referred to the documentary evidence. I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies correctly use the earlier decision in his evaluation. The evidence does not indicate he simply adapted that conclusion. Rather, the judge looked at all of the evidence in the round before reaching a conclusion. There was ample evidence before the judge to reach that conclusion. Based upon this primary finding then the remainder of the claim really fell away. I find the judge gave more than adequate reasons behind his conclusion. In summary, I find no material error of law demonstrated. Decision No material error of law has been shown in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies. Consequently, that decision dismissing the appellant’s appeal shall stand Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly Dated 27th May 2019",2019-05-30

The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq. He made an application for international protection. It was refused and he appealed and following a hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 11 December 2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R L Walker dismissed his appeal.2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. It was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S H Smith on 10 January 2019. His reasons for so granting were:-""1. The Appellant seeks permission to appeal, (in time), against a Decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge RL Walker) who, in a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 11 December, dismissed his appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to reject his asylum claim.2. The grounds assert that the Judge erred by applying the balance of probabilities standard of proof, rather than the lower standard of reasonable likelihood applicable to protection cases.3. There is an arguable material error of law. The Judge's reference at [11] to the balance of probabilities standard applying in ""immigration cases"" may have been a reference to any Article 8 aspects of the appellant's case. In the preceding paragraph, the Judge had correctly summarised the lower standard applicable to protection cases. However, at [26], when conducting his operative analysis of the appellant's credibility, the Judge again cited the balance of probabilities standard. Throughout his discussion of the appellant's core case, the Judge made no further references to the applicable standard of proof. At [45J, the Judge merely referred in generic terms to ""the burden of proof"", without specifying what it was. Arguably, the Judge's analysis of the appellant's case was conducted pursuant to the balance of probabilities standard, which is arguably a material error of law.""3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.4. Mrs Rogers relied on the grounds seeking permission to appeal as highlighted in the decision granting permission recorded above.5. Mrs Petterson whilst acknowledging at paragraph 26 of the decision the Judge applied the civil standard of proof rather than the lower standard. She emphasised that it was apparent that on the individual finding within that paragraph it had been in favour of the Appellant. However, she conceded that on a reading of the decision as a whole the Judge may have materially erred in applying the wrong standard of proof.6. I find that to be the position. The Judge has materially erred by applying the balance of probability standard of proof, rather than the lower standard of reasonable likelihood applicable to protection claims. Whilst the reference to the balance of probabilities in paragraph 11 of his decision may have been to the standard applying in ""immigration cases"" the difficulty arises out of paragraph 26 where once more there is reference to the balance of probabilities when dealing with an issue relating to the protection claim.7. The Judge has accordingly materially erred. Notice of DecisionThe making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be dealt with afresh pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Direction 7(b) before any Judge aside from Judge R L Walker.Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.

A failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, we shall for convenience refer to the parties as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal. Introduction The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 14 November 1979. On 23 July 2016, he was encountered by an Immigration Officer and was detained and served with Immigration Notice IS.91. On 28 July 2016, whilst in detention awaiting removal, the appellant claimed asylum. There followed a Statement of Evidence Form (SEF) on 5 January 2017 and an asylum interview on 5 January 2017. The appellant’s claim was that he had entered the United Kingdom in March 2005 as a result of problems he faced in Bangladesh because of his political opinion. He claimed to be an active member of the BNP and also to be involved in a land dispute with members of the Awami League. He claimed that as a result of an incident in February 2004, he left Bangladesh. He claimed that after he had left Bangladesh, his house was attacked and his family were advised that if he was caught he would be killed. He claimed that a false case was lodged against his brother. He feared that if he returned to Bangladesh he would be killed by the Awami League. On 18 August 2017, the Secretary of State refused the appellant’s claims for asylum, humanitarian protection and on human rights grounds. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In a determination sent on 18 January 2018, Judge J Eames allowed the appellant’s appeal on asylum grounds. He found the appellant’s account to be credible and he accepted that he was an active and prominent member of the BNP who had been arrested and detained on a politically motivated basis and that, as a perceived political opponent, he would be at risk from the Awami League on return to Bangladesh. On 24 January 2018, the Secretary of State sought permission to appeal challenging the judge’s positive credibility finding and also his acceptance that the appellant was at risk on return to Bangladesh, thirteen years after he claimed to have left Bangladesh. On 6 February 2018, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Pedro) granted the appellant permission to appeal. The appellant did not file a rule 24 response. Submissions On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Mills sought to focus the points raised in the Secretary of State’s grounds of appeal. He focussed upon paras 70(a) – (f) and the judge’s reasoning that led him in para 71 to make his positive credibility finding and at para 72 to find, in the appellant’s favour, that the basis of his claim arising from his political opinion was established. In addition, Mr Mills submitted that, in any event, the judge had failed properly to consider whether the appellant was currently at risk, and of interest to the Awami League, given that he had, in his claim, said that he had left Bangladesh in 2005 and had at best a mid-ranking local role between 2002 and 2005. Mr Maqsood submitted that the judge’s reasons at paras 70(a) – (f) were legally sustainable. Further, on the judge’s findings, the judge was entitled to find that the appellant would be a “perceived political opponent” and at risk on return to Bangladesh and since his fear arose from state actors, internal relocation and sufficiency of protection was not available. We will deal with the detail of the submission shortly. We begin, however, with the judge’s reasons. Discussion As we have indicated, the judge’s reasons for making a positive credibility finding (at [71}) and accepting the appellant’s account which put him at risk (at [72}) are set out in the six paras at paras 70(a) – (f). In considering those reasons, it is important to note the context of the appellant’s asylum claim made on 28 July 2016. As we have already identified, in that claim the appellant claimed to have entered the UK in March 2005 using his own passport. In the course of his claim, the appellant accepted that he had previously made an Art 8 claim on 14 November 2017 in a different and false name, namely Poblu Miah. In that earlier claim, he had said that he had entered the United Kingdom in January 2001 using that alias or false name. That, of course, differed from his account in his present application which was that he had not left Bangladesh and come to the UK until March 2005. His earlier claim had been refused (with a right of appeal) on 29 April 2008 and he was served, in the alias name with notice of removal (IS.151A) on 19 May 2008. Not unsurprisingly, this accepted deceptive conduct by the appellant featured in the Secretary of State’s case that the appellant’s credibility was not to be accepted in respect of his claim as now put in his 2016 application for asylum. Judge Eames dealt with the relevance of this matter both in para 70(a) and para 70(f). At para 70(a) the judge said this: “Ms Curran [the Presenting Officer] reasonably enough points to the appellant’s use of an alias name in his previous application. He has explained this by saying this was name he was also called by in Bangladesh. That particular explanation has not been addressed by the respondent. But the burden, low though it is, lies on the appellant. I take into account the fact that as Mr Raza [Counsel for the appellant] rightly says it is the appellant himself who drew attention to the fact that he had used an alias. Perhaps there is only a fine difference between the notion of an alias and that of a false name. In my view it is likely that the appellant had good reason to use a name which on his own oral evidence was one that he was already called in the alternative. As a person allegedly being trafficked into the country by an agent (although one also loosely described as a friend) it is not unlikely he would be under the instruction of that agent and would have done what he was told. None of that is honest or honourable behaviour. On the contrary. But it is reasonably consistent with how asylum seekers may have to behave. So when assessing the impact of the alias story on his overall credibility I am willing to believe that the use of an alias does not negate or invalidate the core of his asylum claim. It is not to be condoned, but does not mean that he is overall dishonest.” At 70(f) the judge said this in relation to s.8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004: “Underlying the respondent’s overall view of credibility are her two section 8 points (of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004), the delay in claiming asylum and use of a false name. In my view the reasoning behind using an alias adequately explains it in a way that does not impugn the appellant’s overall honesty. I addressed this above. His delay in claiming asylum after arriving in the UK was again not particularly honourable or attractive behaviour, once his leave had expired. But until his leave expired, I do not consider there was any pressing duty or requirement on the appellant to put forward his alternative reason for being in the UK, given that he had leave on a genuine and bona fide basis, and that sufficed during its currency. But once it had run out, a genuine question arises as to how far his credibility is undermined by his continuing failure to claim asylum. In my view the explanation for what he did was simply that he was in the UK, life for him in the UK continued to be possible without status, and he took a dishonourable gamble on that being a sustainable position, balanced against the risk that if he did make his asylum claim there was the chance it would be turned down. People sometimes make those calculations about lodging an asylum claim, and whilst it does not enhance their compliance with Immigration Rules, it certainly does not always mean they are dishonest. That I take to be the position here with this appellant. It is unworthy, and discredits him to a degree, but it does not overall mean that I find him lacking credibility.” Mr Mills submitted that the judge had failed in para 70(a) to explain why the appellant’s use of a false name in his 2007 human rights application was explicable on the basis that he had been under the influence of an agent who had trafficked him into the UK. On his account in the present application, that was some two to three years after he had entered the UK in 2005. Mr Mills submitted that, without further reasoning, the judge had failed properly to explain why this past deception was not relevant to the appellant’s credibility in respect of his present application. Further, as regards para 70(f), Mr Mills submitted that the judge was simply wrong to state that the appellant’s delay in claiming asylum was not a relevant matter damaging of his credibility under s.8 of the 2004 Act. Mr Maqsood submitted that it was clear that in para 70(a) the judge was fully alive to the appellant’s previous conduct which he accepted was not honest or honourable behaviour. Nevertheless, he had given sufficient reasons for finding that this earlier deception did not affect the appellant’s credibility or go to the “core” of his claim. In respect of para 70(f), Mr Maqsood submitted that the judge had dealt with the delay in the appellant claiming asylum and, therefore, that s.8 of the 2004 Act did not apply to damage his credibility. In substance, we accept Mr Mills’ submissions. In respect of para 70(a), before the judge the appellant accepted, in essence, that he had previously used deception in making his human rights application in 2007. He had used an alias or false name and, at least contrary to his account in the present application, he had claimed to enter the UK in 2001. His present application claimed that he had entered the UK in 2005. Indeed, he relied upon adverse events in Bangladesh prior to 2005 when, in his earlier application, he had claimed to be in the UK. Whilst an individual’s previous dishonest or deceptive conduct does not, in itself, mean that he or she has necessarily been dishonest in relation to the matters raised in their more recent claim, if not adequately explained, that is a relevant matter in assessing their general credibility and honesty. A person who has been shown previously to be dishonest, or as in this case effectively accepted themselves that they were dishonest, necessarily calls into question their general truthfulness and whether they should be believed in what they say is now the true circumstances. Further, in para 70(a), the judge explained away the appellant’s dishonesty or deceptive behaviour in 2008 as a person who had been “trafficked into the country by an agent…it is not unlikely he would be under the instruction of that agent and would have done what he was told.” Whilst that might explain the use of an alias or false name (including it would seem a false passport) being used on entry (which the appellant claimed in his earlier application was in 2001), the judge gave inadequate reasons for considering that that explanation carried on until 2007 when the appellant made his human rights application in the false name or alias. Even if the appellant were to be accepted (as is his current claim) to have entered the UK in 2005, that would be between 2 and 3 years before his 2007 human rights application. The absence of any adequate explanation as to why he continued to use a false name or alias provided no basis for ignoring, and failing to properly take into account, his earlier dishonesty or deceptive behaviour as relevant to his general credibility and, therefore, the veracity of his current account. As regards para 70(f), the appellant undoubtedly delayed in claiming asylum until 2016 from 2005 (when on his current application he claimed to enter) or 2001 (when on his previous application he claimed to have entered). He had also previously used a false name or alias. Both of these matters fell within s.8 of the 2004 Act. His previous deceptive behaviour was “designed or likely to conceal information” or “designed or likely to mislead” (s.8(2)). Likewise, his delay in claiming asylum fell within s.8(5) as it was a failure by him “to make an asylum claim…before being notified of an immigration decision, unless the claim relies wholly on matters arising after the notification.” In regard to both of those matters, at least without reasonable explanation, they were potentially “damaging” of the appellant’s credibility. Any explanation for his previous dishonest or deceptive behaviour, to the extent that the judge relied on the reason he had already given in para 70(a), could not as we have already noted suffice as a matter of law to explain away that dishonest or deceptive behaviour. In relation to the delay in claiming asylum, the judge’s reasoning is, to say the least, little more than saying that the appellant simply took a “gamble” that, in effect, he would not be apprehended or was to avoid the risk of having his claim turned down. We find that reasoning difficult, in principle, to found a reasonable excuse so as to negate the underlying policy in s.8 that a delay in claiming asylum is “damaging” of a claimant’s credibility. In any event, as we pointed out at the hearing, the judge’s reasoning ignores the fact that the appellant did in fact make a claim, a human rights claim, in 2007. Further, on 29 April 2008, the appellant was given notice that that claim was refused and the appellant was invited under s.120 to make any further representation as to why he should be permitted to remain in the UK. The appellant did not then raise his asylum claim. He delayed doing so, for no explicable reason, until 2016, some eight years later. The judge’s explanation that the appellant took a “dishonourable gamble” cannot bear the weight he gives it in the light of the full opportunity that the appellant was given in 2007/08 to make an asylum claim when he was both making a human rights’ claim and had been invited to raise any other grounds on which he wished to claim that he was entitled to remain in the UK. In our judgment, the appellant’s conduct plainly fell within s.8, in particular within s.8(5), in that he failed to make his asylum claim before being notified of an immigration decision, most recently the IS.91 on 23 July 2006 and, more generally, in response to the refusal of his human rights claim on 29 April 2008. We have concluded that the judge’s reasoning in paras 70(a) and (f) cannot be sustained. The judge was not entitled to reach the views he did on these matters as not damaging the appellant’s credibility and he was not entitled to discount the requirements of s.8 of the 2004 Act in the way or for the reasons he did. Mr Mills also challenged the judge’s reasoning in para 70(b) in which the judge made, in effect, a positive identification of the appellant based upon a number of photocopies of photographs which it was said showed him in close proximity to a high profile BNP politician. The judge’s reasoning was as follows: “A central feature of the appellant’s alleged poor credibility, according to the respondent, is his claimed membership of BNP. Ms Curran premised this view chiefly on the inadequacy of the photos at pp87-90. I remind myself that just because I refused Mr Raza’s adjournment application on this very point, this does not mean that I am bound to give him the benefit of any doubt about the photos. It is true that quality is poor and I some of them faces cannot be adequately made out. However I have scrutinised the top picture on page 87 and the bottom pictures on pages 88 and 89. The person the appellant points out as being himself in those three photos does indeed bear a decent resemblance to him, taking into account he passage of time and his ageing over some years. The face of the person he points out as himself, especially in the first on page 87, is clearly visible. The appellant identifies the person to his left – the main speaker in the picture, with a microphone – as the then BNP-affiliated finance minister. That particular fact has not been disputed by the respondent. The appellant answered that question readily and promptly in oral evidence. I find to the lower standard of proof that he is right about the speaker being the finance minister and right about himself being on the minister’s right-hand side. In terms of position within the hierarchy, I’m not persuaded that this must mean the appellant had a named position relation to the finance minister, but he is plainly prominent in the photo, trusted enough by the party to stand right next to a minister, and evidently enjoys at least some status within the ranks. Turning to the second picture on page 88, once again the appellant here is in a prominent position, this time more persuasively as part of a panel at a desk on a stage. Again I think it reasonably likely that that event is a party BNP event involving important members. There can be no doubting the appellant’s prominence at this event or his importance within the party hierarchy at that event. The third photo I highlight, the lower one on page 89, tells me a little less, in that it is plainly a demo which would perhaps have been less exclusive in terms of who was able to attend and get photographed. Nevertheless, the person the appellant identifies as himself in this picture is certainly right at the front of the demo or that part of the demo. His attendance at this event does not look casual or contrived. Applying the lower standard of proof, I find it reasonably likely that the appellant was attending all these events, and was in a position of some importance vis-à-vis the BNP structure.” Mr Mills submitted that these photographs were largely from the mid-1990s when the appellant was 16 or 17 years old. He is now 39 years old. Mr Maqsood, in his submissions, accepted that some of the photographs did, in fact, relate to when the appellant was some 16 to 17 years old but some were more recent dating to 1996 and 2001. Whilst clear and unequivocal photographs of an individual linking him with a particular political event may have some evidential value in supporting his claimed political involvement, a judge should generally be cautious in relying upon visual identity – comparing a photograph with an appellant at a hearing – when the photographic evidence is not challenged in any way. Judges are not experts, in general, in matters of visual identity. Of course, common sense may drive a judge to accept or reject a claimed visual correlation between a photograph and an appellant where there is an unmistakable similarity. But even then, caution needs to be exercised as photographs can be doctored and doppelgangers are not unknown. Here, the judge concluded that there was “decent resemblance” between the individual in the photographs (said to be the appellant) and with the appellant at the hearing. However, in the photographs the individual was clean shaven whilst the appellant at the hearing had a beard. Further, many of the photographs were said to be of the appellant taken when he was 16 – 17 but at the time of the hearing he was 39 years old. In our judgment, the judge placed an impermissible weight upon the photographic evidence in the light of these matters. We would also add that the copies of the photographs which the judge consulted were, very largely, poorly reproduced. At the conclusion of the hearing, we invited Mr Maqsood to provide the originals. We have assumed those would be available, as it had been claimed before Judge Eames that they could be obtained but, in the event, he refused an adjournment to do so. In the result, we were not provided with any of the photographs which, in fact, in copy form were before the judge. In our judgment, the judge was not entitled to conclude on the basis of the copy photographs, based upon his assessment that the individual in the photographs bears a “decent resemblance” to the appellant, that, in fact, those are photographs showing the appellant. In our judgment, these flaws in the judge’s reasoning are significant and materially undermine his positive credibility finding. Mr Mills also raised points in relation to paras 70 (c), (d) and (e) of the judge’s determination. It is not necessary to deal with these points in detail as we take the view that, for the reasons we have already given, the judge’s positive credibility finding is flawed and his decision must, as a result, be set aside. Suffice it to say that Mr Mills did not actively pursue the challenge to para 70(d) where the judge noted that, although the appellant had not referred to his arrest in his asylum interview, as he had done so in his earlier screening interview. Mr Mills accepted that the appellant had not been directly asked in his asylum interview whether he had been arrested. As regard para 70(c), having explained an apparent inconsistency in the evidence of a UK based witness, it does not appear that the witness had any personal knowledge of the appellant claimed political activities in Bangladesh and, as Mr Maqsood submitted, the judge had simply noted that his evidence “does not advance the appellant’s case all that much”. Finally in relation to para 70(e), there was an apparent discrepancy in the appellant’s evidence as to whether or not his brother had been falsely accused of murder or (as he now claimed) of an incident involving a burning car. The judge accepted the appellant’s explanation that this inconsistency or discrepancy was due to a misunderstanding between him and his representatives. However, we note as Mr Mills submitted, that as this incident was central to the appellant’s claim, the judge nowhere explicitly made any finding as to which version was, as a matter of fact, correct. It may be, however, that in accepting the appellant’s credibility in respect of his account at the hearing, the judge implicitly accepted the ‘car burning’ incident had occurred. Given our clear view that the judge’s reasoning in paras 70(a), (b) and (f) cannot stand and that these were significant and material to his positive credibility finding, it is unnecessary to consider Mr Mills’ submission in relation to whether, if believed, the appellant was properly found to be at risk on return to Bangladesh thirteen years after he left. The judge’s findings, flowing from his positive credibility finding, are legally flawed and cannot be sustained. Consequently, his decision to allow the appellant’s appeal on asylum grounds cannot stand and a fresh assessment of his claim must be made. Decision For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant’s appeal involved the making of an error of law. That decision is set aside. Having regard to the nature and extent of fact-finding required and to para 7.2 of the Senior President Practice’s Statement, the proper disposal of this appeal is to remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo rehearing before a judge other than Judge Eames.

The appellant made a claim for protection on the basis that if returned to Iran, his home country, he would face mistreatment on the basis of his political opinion. He is of Kurdish ethnicity. He claimed to support the KDP (rather than the KDPI) and made a living as a cross-border trader with Iraq. 2. He claimed that in November 2015 whilst in Iraq he was given a package which he was told contained leaflets promoting the KDP. Crossing the border back to Iran he encountered police but managed to escape. He said he learnt that Etelaat had been to family home looking for him.3. He decided to leave Iran and travelled back to Iraq and then on to Turkey. From there, he travelled to Greece before passing through various countries until he came to Switzerland. He remained in a camp for around a year but said he did not claim protection. He then travelled on to France before arriving in the United Kingdom. Since being in the United Kingdom he had been posting pro-KDP material on Facebook and attending demonstrations.4. The respondent found his account to be internally inconsistent and did not accept he was wanted by the Iranian authorities.The First tier Tribunal5. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ennals at Manchester on 19 October 2018. In a decision promulgated on 23 October 2018 his appeal was dismissed. The judge found the appellant's account at his asylum interview to be reasonably consistent and he showed a knowledge of the KDP. The judge found an inconsistency about the level of contact with his family. In his oral evidence he said he only spoke his brother once since arriving in the United Kingdom but in his asylum interview said they were in contact once a month. The appellant had indicated he would like to have joined the Peshmerga but had a wife and young son. The judge questioned why, instead of travelling across Europe and leaving his family behind, he did not join them.6. The appellant had produced the letter said to confirm his involvement with the KDP. The judge questioned this, given that he said he had been a supporter rather than a member and on his account only for a short time before the ambush. 7. He also produced photographs said to show him at pro KDP demonstrations. The judge felt the photographs were taken in order to bolster his claim for protection and questioned why he would publish those pictures on the Internet as he claimed. The judge was shown an extract from the appellant's Facebook account but no photographs of the appellant at demonstrations were seen. The judge did not accept it demonstrated he was wanted by the Iranian authorities and concluded by rejecting the claim. The judge did accept he probably left Iran illegally but did not find this will place him at risk.The Upper Tribunal8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the judge had not provided sufficient reasons for the decision.9. At hearing, Mr Khan relied upon the grounds for which application was made.10. In response, Mr Tan said the decision had to be viewed in the round. At paragraph 18 the judge had commented on inconsistencies about contact with his family and questioned the authorities being at his home as promptly as claimed. At paragraph 19 the judge questioned why the appellant, if exposed, did not then seek refuge with his KDP colleagues. Regarding the letter of support, it was a matter for the judge to decide what weight should be attached.11. Regarding his sur place activities and BA (demonstrators in Britain- risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT Mr Tan said that this appellant had no profile in Iran or in the United Kingdom. Regarding his Facebook activity there was no evidence about how widely spread it was. The judge assessed this at paragraph 22. Mr Tan submitted that the judge correctly applied this case law. The decision of HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430 (IAC) was promulgated subsequently.Consideration12. The First-tier judge was the factfinder in relation to the evidence produced. The judge had the details obtained from the appellant by the respondent and his substantive interview. The interview was in January 2018, at which time on the appellant's account he had been out of Iran over 2 years. At question 4 he said that he had contact with one of his brothers maybe once a month for a few minutes. He said he had spoken to him a month have earlier. The judge found this was inconsistent with his oral evidence which was to the effect he had only spoken to his brother once since arriving in the United Kingdom in December 2017.13. At question 16 of his interview he gave a detailed account. He described how after 10 PM he started across the border when they encountered the police. The following morning he telephoned his mother and she said the authorities had visited. They had also searched his brothers' homes. The 1st Tier judge questioned how the authorities would have made the connection so quickly but accepted it was possible.14. The appellant did not claim any political activity in Iran. He was sympathetic towards the KDP was not a member. At question 20 he said he had been supporting the party for one month before the incident. That was when he said he 1st met the Peshmergas. He recounted that by chance he knew the brother of one of the men he met and they began talking. He said it was through this man as a referee that he obtained the letter of support. Before that he said he did not have a lot of information because the authorities restricted media information. He was able to give a detailed account about the KDP and the KDPI.15. The judge was provided with a bundle on behalf of the appellant. This included Facebook prints.16. The judge sets out the assessment of the evidence at paragraph 18 onwards. The judge deals with a letter of support. The judge referred to the appellant stating in oral evidence that he joined the KDP which was not consistent with his earlier account that he was a supporter, not a member. The judge referred to the evidence of his attendance at demonstrations.Conclusions17. I agree with Mr Tan that the decision must be looked at in the round. The judge was presented with a claim which is not uncommon. I accept that the extent of the reasoning is limited but this is dictated contextually by the nature of the claim made and the evidence produced. The respondent did not accept he was wanted by the Iranian authorities. The judge accepted aspects of the claim as possible but also raised various inconsistencies. The judge assessed the evidence at para 17 onwards and the conclusions reached were open. Reasons are given which I find adequate in the circumstance. I can find no error of law in the judge's assessment.18. BA (demonstrators in Britain- risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT held that the risk depended on the type of activity involved; the risk that a person will be identified ; the factors triggering inquiry on return of the person and the factors that would lead to identification at the airport on return or after entry. The Iranian authorities attempt to identify demonstrators outside the Embassy in London by filming demonstrations but there is insufficient evidence to establish that the regime has facial recognition technology in use. The Iranian security apparatus attempts to match names to faces of demonstrators from. The infrequent demonstrator who plays no particular role in demonstrations and whose participation is not highlighted in the media will not face a real risk of identification and therefore not a real risk of consequent ill-treatment, on return. 19. The appellant gave evidence of some sur place activities. However, those activities were very limited. Although the country guidance decision is not referred to the judge did assess the likelihood of the appellant's activities bringing him to adverse attention. At paragraph 21 the judge refers to the absence of evidence that the Iranian authorities systematically check on anyone who attends demonstrations. Country guidance decision does indicate some surveillance but there is nothing to suggest the appellant's profile would place him at risk. Consequently, I do not find a material error demonstrated in respect of how the surplus activities where assessed.20. HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430 (IAC) was promulgated post decision. It found that those of Kurdish ethnicity are reasonably likely to be subjected to heightened scrutiny on return to Iran. However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish ethnicity with or without a valid passport and even if combined with illegal exit, does not create a risk of persecution. Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when combined with other factors, may create a real risk. Even low-level activity perceived to be political, such as, possession of leaflets supporting Kurdish rights involves a risk of persecution but each case depends on its own facts. However in the appellant's case the judge had not accepted found the underlying incident. Again, taking into account this latest guidance I do not find a material error of law.DecisionNo material error of law has been shown in the decision of First-tier Tribunal judge Ennals. Consequently, that decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge FarrellyDated 28th May 2019",2019-05-30

I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall identify the original appellant, whether directly or indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rai promulgated on 27 February 2019 allowing the claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to deport him to his country of origin, India, following two criminal offences committed in the United Kingdom after he obtained indefinite leave to remain.Background The claimant entered the United Kingdom on 19 April 1990 as a child as a dependant of his father, who claimed asylum unsuccessfully. In 2007 this claimant successfully sought indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 14 years' unlawful residence in the United Kingdom.He had indefinite leave to remain from 24 August 2007, when he would have been 22 years old. On 20 August 2010, by which time he was 25 years old, the claimant was convicted of wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm and destroying or damaging property and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, wholly suspended for eighteen months. On 14 October 2013 he was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment, which was not suspended.On 20 March 2014 the claimant was notified of his liability to automatic deportation, gave reasons why he should not be deported and made further submissions on asylum grounds.On 26 January 2016 the Secretary of State signed a deportation order, refusing on the same date the asylum and human rights claim and certifying his refusal under Section 94B of the 2002 Act. The Secretary of State's reasons are summarised at paragraph 9 of the First-tier Tribunal decision.First-tier Tribunal decision The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal on the basis that the claimant's removal would be unduly harsh for two children. The first an 8-year-old child from his marriage and the second the child of his present partner, a person whom he has met at school in England. The claimant and his current partner have known each other for a very long time and his partner's child, with whom the claimant gets on well, is 10 years old. The consideration of whether if the claimant is removed it will be unduly harsh for these two children to remain in the United Kingdom without him is set out at [42] - [51] in the First-tier Tribunal decision. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the two children get on well together, noting that the claimant's relationship with his former wife has completely broken down and they communicate only through solicitors or by text message these days. There is a contact order in place as a result of which the claimant's child from his marriage sees her father every weekend and also sees her father's extended family, who are paying for private school in the United Kingdom for her. There is no question that the children are both qualifying children because they are both British citizens and it was accepted before the First-tier Tribunal that these children could not, for various reasons, be expected to go and live in India with the claimant if he is removed.The judge's reasoning is at paragraphs 45 and 51 in particular of the First-tier Tribunal's decision as follows:""45. I accept this [the inability to go to live in India] would be the position and delving into hypothetical situations serves no purpose, especially where the evidence presented is strong and demonstrates significant bonds [his daughter] has with her biological mother, stepsibling and extended family and friends. Ms Zwizwai's report states that if the [claimant] went to India [the child's] mother would have difficulty in promoting contact. She has her own health issues with a prolapsed disc, which causes mobility issues, but also has no family ties in India. This would mean [the child] would never be able to see her father while growing up unless Ms Sahota allowed her to travel to India, which at this moment in time seems unlikely. Given all the evidence in the round, I find it would be in [the child's] best interests to remain in the UK.?51. The evidence of the [claimant] is that [the child] is now settled and in a routine with visits to her father's house. [The child] is able to maintain and build on important relationships formed with her father's side of the family. This is a stark contrast from the effect the [claimant's] absence had on [the child] previously. Both social worker reports confirm the negative effects suffered by [the child] and going forward the effect it may have on her emotional and psychological development. Having found this to be the case, I find the long-term effects are of a harshness which can only be described as 'bleak' or 'severe'. They go beyond a level of harshness that is acceptable or justifiable, even within the context of the high public interest in the deportation of foreign offenders provided at Section 117C(1).""Permission to appeal The Secretary of State challenged that decision, arguing that although it was accepted that it would not be in the best interests of the child if the claimant were to be deported she would remain with her mother, who is her primary carer, and her new family, her mother has a new relationship with another child, which provides a secure and stable home environment.The grounds conclude:""The situation facing [the child] and her mother is not dissimilar to that faced by many families where one of the biological parents is to be deported but [she] has the support of her mother and her new partner and as such all her basic needs will be met. The separation of a healthy child whose basic needs will be met with no specific concerns raised from her biological father even for a long time is not sufficient to outweigh the public interest in deportation.""Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge as follows:""2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Rai found that the social work evidence confirmed that the best interests of the appellant child were for him to remain in the United Kingdom and that going forward there will be negative effects suffered by [the child] which may have an impact on her emotional and psychological development. The judge concluded that the long-term effects would be of a harshness which can only be described as bleak or severe and go beyond a level of harshness that is acceptable or justifiable in the context of Section 117C(5).3. The grounds arguing that the social work evidence did not justify that conclusion is arguable.""That is the basis on which this case came before the Upper Tribunal today.Social worker's reportWhat was the evidence before the judge in this case? It was accepted that there is a strong bond between the claimant and his child, and also between the claimant and his partner's child. There was before the judge a social work assessment by Sophie Zwizwai, who described herself as an independent social worker. Ms Zwizwai considered that there was likely to be an adverse impact on the child's welfare from a second separation from her father, which is ""very likely to cause considerable harm to the integrity of [her] family life"". In her report at [20], Ms Zwizwai noted the remorse that the claimant had expressed. There followed a lengthy discussion of attachment theory and of the familial relationships, much of which appears to be speculative, ending with rather generic conclusions that the removal of the claimant from the United Kingdom would not be in the child's best interests. There was no evidence of previous disruption or bad behaviour by the child following on from separation while her father was incarcerated.The report concluded at [41]:""As discussed in this report, children from separated families may experience more externalising problems such as conduct disorders, delinquency and impulsive behaviour than kids from two parent families. [The child] has suffered multiple separations already and any further separation would not be in her best interests and will not promote her growth and development. It is imperative that children are provided with a sufficiently stable environment to enable them to develop and maintain a secure attachment to their primary caregivers to ensure optimum development, ensuring attachments are not disrupted, providing consistency of emotional warmth over time. This is very important for [the child] as she is growing up. Howe (2005) states that attachment theory values the idea that parents need to connect with their children's emotional and mental states and social understanding. Given the current funding and inheritance arrangements by the daughter's grandfather and the new social circumstances of the biological mother, it is being argued that the deportation of the father would adversely affect the young daughter in multiple ways. There is also no guarantee that the existing contact order would be adhered to as prescribed.""No copy of that contact order is before me and the Family Court Protocol has not been activated.Submissions For the Secretary of State, I heard submissions from Ms Willocks-Briscoe, who relied on the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal, noting that modern means of communication would be available to maintain contact between the child and her father if he were in India rather than the United Kingdom and that the evidence before the First-tier Judge was not over and above what would be experienced by any child whose father was deported as a foreign criminal. She relied on paragraphs 49 to 51 of the First-tier Tribunal decision and the social worker report, to which I have had regard. Dealing with the unduly harsh test, the Secretary of State relied on The Secretary of State v AJ (Zimbabwe) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012, at [16] in the decision of Lord Justice Elias, with whom Lord Justice Vos agreed. For the claimant, Mr Murphy argued that the Secretary of State's grounds were really no more than a disagreement with a conclusion which was open to the judge on the evidence before her, that the offence was years ago, the conviction having been in 2014, and that the child had already experienced one separation from her father when she was 2 years old. Every child was different and the likely effect of the claimant being removed to India was that the relationship with his child from his marriage and between that child and his extended family would break down despite the fact that they were paying the school fees and that the difference in quality between being able to have his daughter every weekend and half and half in the holidays and having remote contact by modern means of communication was sufficient to amount to undue harshness.Mr Murphy also argued that the child would lose the relationship which had been growing between her and her stepmother and her stepbrother and which was a significant addition to the child's family life. Mr Murphy submitted that the First-tier Judge had directed herself properly and reached a conclusion which was open to her in a well-reasoned and rational decision. Legal frameworkThe claimant is a foreign criminal. It is common ground that Exception 1 in section 117C(3) is not applicable. The best interests of relevant children can outweigh the public interest in deportation only if Exception 2 at section 117C(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended), applies:""117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign criminals(1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.(2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal. ?(5) Exception 2 applies where C has ? a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.""I am guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in AD Lee v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 348 in March 2011, in which Lord Justice Sedley, giving the judgment of the court, in an appellant's appeal against a decision upholding the deportation order, said this:""27. The tragic consequence is that this family, short-lived as it has been, will be broken up for ever because of the appellant's bad behaviour. That is what deportation does. Sometimes the balance between its justification and its consequences falls the other way but whether it does so is a question for an Immigration Judge. Unless he has made a mistake of law in reaching his conclusion - and we readily accept that this may include an error of approach - his decision is final. ?""The Court of Appeal in AJ (Zimbabwe) in 2016 held that something more than separation and emotional upset is required to outweigh the significant public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals:""16. More recently, this court considered a number of appeals together in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662. In some of the cases sentences of between 12 months and four years had been imposed. Jackson LJ, delivering the judgment of the court (Jackson, Sharp and Sales LJJ) made this observation with respect to the interests of the children in the context of 'exceptional circumstances' (paras. 33-34):'?.. it inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in which circumstances are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the high public interest in deportation will be rare. The commonplace incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in poor health or the natural love between parents and children, will not be sufficient.The best interests of children certainly carry great weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 at [145]. Nevertheless, it is a consequence of criminal conduct that offenders may be separated from their children for many years, contrary to the best interests of those children. The desirability of children being with both parents is a commonplace of family life. That is not usually a sufficiently compelling circumstance to outweigh the high public interest in deporting foreign criminals...""The court then cited with approval the observations of Rafferty LJ in para. 38 of the CT (Vietnam) case, reproduced in para. 14 above.17. These cases show that it will be rare for the best interests of the children to outweigh the strong public interest in deporting foreign criminals. Something more than a lengthy separation from a parent is required, even though such separation is detrimental to the child's best interests. That is commonplace and not a compelling circumstance. Neither is it looking at the concept of exceptional circumstances through the lens of the Immigration Rules. It would undermine the specific exceptions in the Rules if the interests of the children in maintaining a close and immediate relationship with the deported parent were as a matter of course to trump the strong public interest in deportation. Rule 399(a) identifies the particular circumstances where it is accepted that the interests of the child will outweigh the public interest in deportation. The conditions are onerous and will only rarely arise. They include the requirement that it would not be reasonable for the child to leave the UK and that no other family member is able to look after the child in the UK. In many, if not most, cases where this exception is potentially engaged there will be the normal relationship of love and affection between parent and child and it is virtually always in the best interests of the child for that relationship to continue. If that were enough to render deportation a disproportionate interference with family life, it would drain the rule of any practical significance. It would mean that deportation would constitute a disproportionate interference with private life in the ordinary run of cases where children are adversely affected and the carefully framed conditions in rule 399(a) would be largely otiose. In order to establish a very compelling justification overriding the high public interest in deportation, there must be some additional feature or features affecting the nature or quality of the relationship which take the case out of the ordinary.""I am also guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) & Ors [2018] UKSC 53 in the judgment of Lord Carnwath, with whom Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed and Lord Briggs agreed, and in particular at paragraph 23 thereof:""23. On the other hand the expression 'unduly harsh; seems clearly intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of reasonableness under Section 117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word unduly implies an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a due level of harshness, that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. 'Unduly' implies something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set by Section 117C(1), that is the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my view (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next Section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent's offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the Section itself by reference to length of sentence?"",and at paragraph 27:""27. Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of 'unduly harsh' in this context was given by the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J President and UT Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC), [2015] INLR 563, paragraph 46, a decision given on 15 April 2015. They referred to the evaluative assessment required of the Tribunal:'By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh' does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context denotes something 'severe' or 'bleak'. It is the antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb unduly raises an already elevated standard still higher.'""Analysis The question for the Tribunal is whether the First-tier Judge gave adequate weight to the public interest in deportation in section 117C and Exception 2 in section 117C(4): would the removal of this claimant have an effect on a child with whom he has a parental relationship, which is 'unduly harsh' in the sense of 'bleak or severe'. I do not consider that the child of his new partner, despite the good relationship he has with that child, although a British citizen and thus a qualifying child, is one with whom he has a genuine parental relationship: that child has a father who is still involved, and a mother with whom the child lives.The relevant child is the claimant's own child from his former marriage. It is accepted that it would be in the child's best interests to have the claimant remain in the United Kingdom. However, the evidence, including the social worker's report, is only of the normal type of upset which the separation of a child from its father causes. That child has a mother, a step-father, a half-sibling, and paternal grandparents who would still be in the United Kingdom, and who are sufficiently involved to have made inheritance provision and pay for the child's schooling. The child of the marriage would lose connection with the child of the claimant's new partner, but would still have the new family and the extended family. I am satisfied that the evidence before the Judge did not come close to 'bleak or severe' consequences for the claimant's child if he is removed. Rather, this is the type of 'due' harshness which inevitably follows from serious criminal behaviour and conviction.The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, and I substitute a decision dismissing the claimant's appeal.ConclusionsThe making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of law.I set aside the decision. I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.Signed Judith AJC Gleeson Date: 24 May 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson",2019-05-30
