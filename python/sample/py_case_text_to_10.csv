0,[2019] UKUT 217,"R (on the application of Sutharsan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (UT rule 29(1): time limit) [2019] UKUT 00217 (IAC)In the Upper TribunalImmigration and Asylum ChamberJudicial ReviewNotice of DecisionThe Queen on the application ofNADARAJAH SUTHARSAN ApplicantvSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT RespondentThe 21-day time limit in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 for filing an acknowledgment of service in immigration judicial review proceedings begins to run on the day after the person concerned is provided with a copy of the application for judicial review, not on the day it was sent. A copy that is sent by post will be deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved.Decision of the Honourable Mr Justice LaneFollowing consideration of all documents filed, including the letter dated 21 June 2019 from the applicant's representatives, the Tamil Welfare Association (Newham) UK.The respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed within the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Reasons:1. The applicant contends that the respondent's acknowledgment of service, filed on 20 June 2019, was filed outside the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The respondent asserts that it was served within that period. If the applicant is correct, it is common ground that the respondent has not made an application, accompanied by the requisite fee, for time to be extended.2. So far as relevant, rule 29(1) provides that:-""A person who is sent or provided with a copy of an application for permission"" [to bring judicial review proceedings and who wishes to take part in them] ""must provide to the Upper Tribunal an acknowledgment of service so that it is received no later than no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal sent, or in immigration judicial review proceedings the applicant provided a copy of the application to that person"".3. The applicant says that a copy is provided to the person concerned on the date it is sent to that person. This means the 21-day period begins to run on the day after it was sent, whether or not the person to whom it was sent has received it.3. The applicant's position necessarily involves the proposition that sending and providing amount to the same thing. It is, however, evident from rule 29(1) that the legislature regards sending and providing as different. Otherwise, there would have been no purpose in SI 2011/2343 inserting the words in square brackets, which occurred on 17 October 2011, when UTIAC acquired jurisdiction to decide ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews. 4. Any doubt as to this is dispelled by reading the consultation paper and annexes, which the Tribunal Procedure Committee (TPC) published in 2011, concerning proposed changes to the 2008 Rules, consequent upon the assumption by the Upper Tribunal of jurisdiction in ""fresh claim"" judicial reviews (FCJRs)1. The annex attached to the TPC's consultation paper reveals that the original proposed wording of rule 29 read: ""? so that it is received no later than 21 days after the date on which the Upper Tribunal or in fresh claim judicial review proceedings the applicant sent a copy of the application to that person"". 5. The consultation paper, however, made reference to: ""CPR 58.8(2), which allows a total of 23 days for lodging an acknowledgment of service (2 days for postal service and 21 days from receipt of the application). Rule 29(1) allows 21 days for this to be done. The Committee is considering whether to make special provision for FCJRs that would maintain the 23 day time limit or to specify a shorter time limit given the nature of FCJRs""6. The TPC published a reply to the consultation responses, in which we find the following:""The majority of respondents suggested that the CPR should be replicated in order to avoid having different rules depending on the venue"". The conclusion of the TPC was that it ""agreed that it was appropriate to replicate the CPR time limit"". 7. The amendments to rule 29(1) that were eventually made in 2011 were, therefore, intended to reflect CPR 54.8(2)(a), which governs applications for judicial review in the High Court. CPR 54.8(2)(a) prescribes a period of 21 days ""after service of the claim form"" on the person concerned. The fact that service may not be effected until that person is put in possession of the claim form is made clear by CPR 6.14, which provides that a claim form is deemed to be served on the second business day after completion of what is termed the relevant step under rule 7.5(1). For posting by first class post, the relevant step is ""posting"".8. This legislative background makes it plain that the references to providing in the amended rule 29(1) were used in order to keep fresh claim judicial review (and, now, immigration judicial review) in step with the relevant High Court time limit. The applicant's interpretation, however, would entirely defeat this purpose.9. In Bhavsar (late application for PTA: procedure) [2019] UKUT 00196 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal examined the effect of amendments made by SI 2018/511 to rule 33 (Application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014. The amendments replaced the references in rule 33 to ""provided"" with references to ""sent"". As the Upper Tribunal noted at paragraph 26 of its decision, the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 stated that the replacement of the references was done ""in order to clarify that the time period for an application to be sent to the Tribunal is calculated by reference to the date on which the written reasons for the decision are sent to the party making the application"".10. At paragraph 28 of Bhavsar, the Upper Tribunal said:""Despite the implication in the Explanatory Note to SI 2018/511 that the substitution of ""sent"" for ""provided"" had been made merely in order ""to clarify"" the position, it is, in our view, clear that a substantive change had in fact been made. As a matter of ordinary language, a person is ""provided"" with a physical thing when he or she receives or takes possession of it. In the present case, that was on 22 June 2018, when the appellant's solicitors received the First-tier Tribunal's decision, along with form IA60. The fourteen-day time limit, accordingly, would have expired on 5 July 2018, but for the amendment to rule 33 made by SI 2018/511.""11. The account in paragraphs 3 to 7 above of how rule 29(1) came to be amended in 2011 underscores the correctness of what was said in Bhavsar. Serving and providing are not synonymous (see also: R (Javed) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 4426 (Admin)).12. It is undoubtedly the fact that something can be provided to a person in a variety of ways, which involve not only sending the thing via an intermediary, such as the Royal Mail, but also providing the thing directly by hand. If the applicant were correct in his assertion that sending a thing amounts to providing it on the date of sending, the applicant could unilaterally shorten the period of 21 days in rule 29(1) by choosing to send the copy application, rather than effecting personal service at the office of the respondent's legal representative, the Government Legal Department. Such an outcome cannot be correct.13. The references to providing in rule 29(1) are, nevertheless, not free from difficulty, in that the 2008 Rules contain no express provision like CPR 6.14, making it clear that a document sent by post by one party to someone other than the Tribunal is deemed to be served/received on the second business day after posting. In this regard, it does not appear that section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 applies (see Syed (curtailment of leave - notice) [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC)). It is plainly in the interests of the overriding objective in rule 2 to interpret the references to providing in rule 29(1) as including the position that a copy application which is sent by post is deemed to have been provided on the second business day after it was posted, unless the contrary is proved. Pursuant to rule 2(3)(b), that is how the references will be interpreted by the Tribunal.14. In the application with which I am concerned, the applicant sent a copy of the application to the respondent on 29 May 2019. There is no dispute it was received by the respondent on 30 May 2019 and so deemed service does not arise. In view of what I have said above, it was on 30 May that the respondent was provided with the relevant document for the purposes of rule 29(1). The 21-day period therefore began to run on 31 May and ended on 20 June, which was the day that the acknowledgment of service was received by the Upper Tribunal.

1,[2019] UKUT 216," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Smith (appealable decisions; PTA requirements; anonymity) [2019] UKUT 00216 (IAC) THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On 7 May 2019    …………………………………   Before THE HON. MR JUSTICE LANE, PRESIDENT UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GILL UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE FINCH Between THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Appellant and MORGAN HAYAT SMITH (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE) Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer For the Respondent: Mr B. Amunwa, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co Solicitors (1) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (2) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (3) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (4) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (2) above). (5) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (6) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (7) When deciding whether to make an anonymity direction, the starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Subject to statutory prohibitions on disclosure, any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. DECISION AND REASONS A. Introduction The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of Belgium, born in July 1988. He has a history of offending as a juvenile. As an adult, he was convicted in 2017 of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress; four counts of battery; assaulting a constable; and failing to surrender to custody at the appointed time. The offence of battery was committed whilst the claimant was on bail. On 15 September 2017, after considering the claimant’s representations as to why he should not be deported from the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State made a deportation order against the claimant. He did not appeal against that decision and was deported on 3 November 2017. Two days later, the claimant attempted to return but was refused entry to the United Kingdom. On 14 January 2018, the claimant was arrested by police, having entered in breach of the deportation order. The claimant was removed on 18 March 2018. The following day, he was encountered embarking on a ferry in Scotland. He was removed again on 7 May 2018. On 31 May 2018, the claimant again entered the United Kingdom, in breach of the deportation order. On 15 June 2018, the claimant was convicted of knowingly entering the United Kingdom in breach of the deportation order, for which he was fined. B. The decision letter Those acting for the claimant subsequently made representations, which the Secretary of State treated as an application for the deportation order to be revoked. On 19 July 2018, the Secretary of State explained why he had, in effect, decided not to do so. The letter took account of the claimant’s assertion that he had lived in the United Kingdom for the majority of his life, having lived here between the ages of 5 and 9 before returning to the United Kingdom in 2011 aged 12. The Secretary of State, on the basis of the evidence submitted, refused to accept that the claimant had been resident in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”), for a continuous period of five years. The decision letter noted that the claimant had “lost his temper on three separate occasions against 2 females and on those occasions, he in fits of anger assaulted both of them”. This included pushing his ex-partner by the throat until she passed out, after which he “continued to torment her by posting private and indecent photographs of her on the internet in order to humiliate her”. On another occasion, the claimant threw items around his flat, hitting his current partner with a wooden incense dispenser, as a result of which she was taken to hospital for treatment. He subsequently assaulted his current partner by slamming her into a bathroom mirror, before pinning her down on the floor and placing a blanket around her face and neck. The decision letter found that the claimant had a propensity to reoffend and represented a very genuine and persistent sufficiently serious threat to the public to justify maintaining his deportation. Having considered the issue of proportionality, by reference to the claimant’s submissions about difficulties he would face in Belgium, the letter concluded that it would be reasonable to expect the claimant to go to Belgium and resume his life there. The letter explained in detail why, in circumstances of the claimant’s case, his deportation to Belgium would not disproportionately interfere with his rehabilitation. At paragraph 58 of the letter, the Secretary of State concluded that deportation was proportionate and in accordance with the principles and regulations of 23(6)(b) of the 2016 Regulations. The decision letter then turned to consider Article 8 of the ECHR. Paragraph 59 reads:- “In addition to considering your client’s position under EU law and the EA Regulations 2016, consideration has separately been given to whether your client’s deportation would breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).” The letter noted the various elements of the claimant’s Article 8 claim, which were that he had a girlfriend in the United Kingdom, who was pregnant; that his mother remained in the United Kingdom; and that he had established a private life by virtue of his residence and education in the United Kingdom. So far as the claimant’s partner was concerned, the Secretary of State considered that the claimant did not have a genuine and subsisting relationship with her, in light of his conviction for battery against that partner. There was also no evidence of co-habitation. So far as private life was concerned, the letter explained why the Secretary of State did not consider that the claimant was socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. This was because the claimant was a persistent offender, having been convicted 8 times of 15 offences within a relatively short period of time in the United Kingdom and his “conviction history indicates an anti-social attitude towards the public and community and shows that he has not integrated into the United Kingdom society”. It was not considered that there would be very significant obstacles to the claimant’s integration into Belgium. At paragraph 79 of the letter, the Secretary of State undertook an analysis of whether there were very compelling circumstances, such as to make it incompatible with Article 8 for the claimant to be deported. For the reasons given, it was concluded that there were no such circumstances in the claimant’s case. Paragraph 84 of the letter concluded the Article 8 analysis as follows:- “Having carefully considered the facts about [the claimant’s] circumstances it is considered that [the claimant’s] deportation would not breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under ECHR Article 8 because the public interest in deporting [the claimant] outweighs his right to private and family life” Under the heading “Appeal”, the letter told the claimant that “you have a right of appeal against the decision under regulation 36 and 37 of the 2016 EEA Regulations. Information on how to appeal and the time limits for appealing are contained in the attached notice”. C. Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal On 3 August 2018, the claimant (who remained in the United Kingdom) filed a notice of appeal in the First-tier Tribunal. The grounds of appeal contended that the claimant did not meet the threshold for deportation of an EEA national with permanent residence and that his deportation would disproportionately interfere with his EU rights “and his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights, including article 8”. The case was heard at Harmondsworth on 15 October 2018 by Immigration Judge Lal. The claimant was present at the hearing and gave evidence, upon which he was cross-examined. The judge also heard evidence from the claimant’s mother and his current partner “who confirmed that she had been the victim of the [claimant’s] offending in the past but she thought that he had changed” (paragraph 60 of the decision). The judge found that the claimant had been in the United Kingdom for over five years and had acquired a permanent right of residence. The judge was satisfied that the claimant “did produce credible evidence of some insight into his crimes” and that he had “reasonably addressed issues of anger management, the impact of his actions on victims and how he would deal with those situations which he accepts were the cause of his previous problems”. The judge concluded that deportation on serious grounds of public policy/public security “are not made out”, finding that the claimant is “back with his partner and he has no links with Belgium” (paragraph 25). There was “credible evidence” that the claimant “has family life in the UK with his mother and that all his siblings and his partner are here and it would be disproportionate to expect [the claimant] to leave the UK at the present time” (paragraph 26). In the light of these findings, the judge allowed “the appeal against the deportation order” (paragraph 28). Paragraph 27 of the judge’s decision reads as follows:- “27. In the light of its findings above the Tribunal did not go on to consider Article 8 separately.” D. Challenging the First-tier Tribunal’s decision The Secretary of State applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the judge’s decision to allow the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. The grounds contended that the judge had been wrong to conclude that the claimant had acquired a permanent right of residence, given that “residence alone is insufficient” and there were no findings that the claimant had lived for the requisite time in accordance with the 2016 Regulations. That error infected the judge’s proportionality findings. The judge had also failed to have regard to Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations, wherein paragraph 3 was of particular relevance, given the claimant’s persistent offending. The judge had also, according to the Secretary of State, failed to give adequate reasons for the findings in respect of the claimant’s criminal offending; in particular, since the pre-sentence report considered the claimant to be at high risk of causing serious harm to women. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 1 November 2018, by reference to each of the Secretary of State’s grounds. On 24 January 2019, shortly before the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, the claimant’s solicitors filed a response under rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (“the 2008 Rules”). The response contended that the First-tier Tribunal judge had not erred in his conclusions in respect of the 2016 Regulations. The response also, however, contained what was described as a “cross appeal”, in which the claimant “hereby makes an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (directly) to cross appeal the determination of FTJ Lal in respect of the findings (specifically non-findings) in relation to Article 8 ECHR” (paragraph 16). The response went on to give reasons why the application for permission was being made out of time. As to this, the claimant:- “ … asks the Court (sic) to note that the [claimant] appealed on two grounds against the decision of the SSHD; firstly that the decision was in breach of EU Law and secondly that the decision breached his rights under ECHR. The appeal was allowed on the former ground and that therefore there was no benefit in him appealing the decision in relation to the latter. If it were the case that Appellant’s (sic) should appeal on all grounds (even less favourable) to which they have been successful on it will result in a chaotic administration of the Tribunal appeal system and contrary to the overriding objective in both the FTT and Upper Tier Procedure Rules” (paragraph 18). The response stated that the Secretary of State had made a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim and that an appeal against that refusal was, accordingly, before the First-tier Tribunal judge. It “was not open to him to just decide not to deal with it as he did in paragraph 27 of the determination and reasons”. The response explained that the claimant’s human rights claim was, in part, based on the fact that he contended he had an entitlement to British citizenship through his adopted British father. There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to support this contention, including an adoption certificate. The First-tier Tribunal judge, when faced with this submission, declined to deal with it. The relevant part of the judge’s decision is as follows: - “9. Mr Grennan [Home Office Presenting Officer] submitted that the proper remedy for the [claimant] was by way of judicial review and this of nationality (sic) had never been raised before. He urged the Tribunal to carry on with the appeal. 10. The Tribunal agreed with Mr Grennan as it was faced with an appeal against the deportation order. If it was to be now advanced that the [claimant] was not a national of the receiving country than that [sic] had to be specifically raised with the SSHD. It had not been done so in this case [sic].” F. Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal The appeal came before Julian Knowles J, and Upper Tribunal Judge Gill for hearing on 29 January 2019. The hearing was adjourned. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill gave directions on 30 January, requiring the Secretary of State to explain his reasons for failing to comply with earlier directions of the Upper Tribunal, which had required service of a skeleton argument. She also directed that the parties should file and serve skeleton arguments addressing, inter alia, whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, given that regulation 34(4) of the 2016 Regulations required an application to revoke an EA deportation order to be made from outside the United Kingdom; and whether the permission of the First-tier Tribunal/Upper Tribunal was required in order for the claimant to cross-appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge on the ground that the judge did not consider the claimant’s Article 8 claim. The adjourned hearing was heard by the present constitution of the Upper Tribunal on 7 May 2019. By that time, the parties had each served a number of skeleton arguments, speaking notes and applications. We found these documents of considerable assistance, supplemented as they were by the oral submissions of Mr Jarvis and Mr Amunwa. G. The jurisdictional issue The first issue is whether the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions of 30 January referred to regulation 34. So far as relevant, this reads as follows: - “Revocation of deportation and exclusion orders 34.- (1) An exclusion order remains in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A deportation order remains in force— until the order is revoked under this regulation; or for the period specified in the order. (3) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may only apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked on the basis that there has been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (4) An application under paragraph (3) must set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (5) On receipt of an application under paragraph (3), the Secretary of State must revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (6) The Secretary of State must take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” So far as appeals are concerned, regulation 37, again so far as relevant, provides as follows: - “37.- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person may not appeal under regulation 36 whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - (a) to refuse to admit that person to the United Kingdom; (b) to revoke that person’s admission to the United Kingdom; (c) to make an exclusion order against that person; (d) to refuse to revoke a deportation or exclusion order made against the person; … 37.- (2) Sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of paragraph (1) do not apply where the person is in the United Kingdom; and - …” The first point to observe is that neither the representatives nor the First-tier Tribunal judge appeared to have been aware at all of what is said in regulations 34 and 37. So far as the First-tier Tribunal judge was concerned, this may be because the judge considered, wrongly, that the EEA appeal was against the Secretary of State’s decision to make a deportation order against the claimant, rather than its being against the decision to refuse to revoke that order. This is apparent from paragraphs 3 and 29 of the Judge’s decision. It is also apparent that the writer of the Secretary of State’s decision letter was unaware of regulation 34(4), which – as we see - provides that an application to revoke a deportation order may be made only whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. Whether the Secretary of State is able to waive that requirement in such a way as to keep the resulting decision within the ambit of the 2016 Regulations is a moot point. It is, however, an issue upon which the parties did not make discrete submissions and, in the circumstances, we are not persuaded that it is appropriate for us to say more about it. Attention in fact focused upon regulation 37(1)(d) which, as we can also see, provides in terms that a person may not appeal whilst in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against that person. The appellant was in the United Kingdom when the notice of appeal was filed. In Anwar and Adjo v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1275, the Court of Appeal considered the effect of section 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which, as then in force, provided as follows: “92. Appeal from within United Kingdom: general (1) A person may not appeal under section 82(1) while he is in the United Kingdom unless his appeal is of a kind to which this section applies. (2) This section applies to an appeal against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(c), (d), (e), (f) and (j). ….. (4) This section also applies to an appeal against an immigration decision if the appellant— (a) has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim, while in the United Kingdom, or ……” In Nirula v the First-tier Tribunal (Asylum and Immigration Chamber & another) and Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1436, the Court of Appeal explained that Sedley LJ’s judgment in Anwar had, in effect, been misunderstood: - “27. The question that arose in Anwar was whether a tribunal could proceed to a determination in a deception case if the appellant was inside the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State had determined that the appellant had obtained leave to remain by deception; on appeal the Secretary of State objected to the tribunal hearing the appeal because the appellant was in the United Kingdom. The tribunal decided it did have jurisdiction and, moreover, that the appellant had not obtained leave by deception. The Secretary of State obtained an order for reconsideration and, on reconsideration, the AIT decided that the appeal could not be pursued while the appellant remained in the United Kingdom and there was thus no jurisdiction in the tribunal to entertain the appeal. This court then granted permission to appeal to Mr Anwar as well as to another appellant (Ms Pangeyo) who raised the same point. By the time Mr Anwar's appeal came to be heard, the Secretary of State had agreed that he had not obtained leave by deception but since the case was ready for argument, both sides were heard on the question of jurisdiction ""at the court's request"" (para 9). ” 28. Anwar is therefore a considered decision of this court, contained in a reserved judgment, on the question whether a tribunal (then the AIT, now the FTT) has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against removal in a deception case when the appellant is in the United Kingdom. Sedley LJ (with whom Lloyd and Sullivan LJJ agreed) set out the facts, the statutory provisions and the issues, explaining how the first tribunal came to consider that they did have jurisdiction. He then proceeded to decide the jurisdiction point under the heading ""Jurisdiction"" 29. “…In circumstances in which this court has requested argument on a point about jurisdiction and has expressly decided that question, its reasoning must be treated as part of the ratio of the case. Mr Ockelton thought that because the point on jurisdiction had been taken in Anwar's two cases as per paragraph 23 above, the whole of the rest of this passage was obiter with the result that, had it been relevant to his decision, he could have disagreed with it because it was wrong. This is with respect a misunderstanding of the doctrine of precedent in two quite separate ways. In the first place, judges at first instance should accept a considered judgment of this court on a question of jurisdiction as a judgment that binds them. In the second place Mr Ockelton was able to decide (in my view correctly) that the point on jurisdiction had been taken in this case. In these circumstances his own remarks about what the position would be if the point had not been taken at all (or not been taken by the right person) were themselves obiter, as he himself acknowledges in his judgment. On the basis on which Mr Ockelton proceeded (namely that the views on jurisdiction in Anwar were obiter), it is not appropriate for a first instance judge to say obiter that considered remarks of this court are wrong. One consequence is a disruption to the body of authority by which tribunals are guided. If he believes that the view of this court is wrong, a judge of first instance should give permission to appeal. If this court where it falls for decision in an appropriate case considers the view to be wrong (and obiter) it will say so and first instance tribunals will know where they are. 30. Of course any decision of this court is only authority for what it decides and for any reasoning necessary for that decision. One thing that is immediately clear from paragraphs 19-23 of the Anwar decision is that nothing is said on the question whether the tribunal is entitled to take a point on its own jurisdiction of its own motion. That is a point which remains open for decision. It is not a particularly difficult decision. In my view any tribunal is entitled (and indeed well advised) to air any doubts it has about its jurisdiction and invite submissions on that question and then decide it. Anwar does not question that proposition in any way. 31. Mr Ockelton, however, thought (para 47(b)) that it was ""implicit"" in Anwar that the jurisdiction point has to be taken by the party affected and it is true that in paragraph 19 of his judgment Sedley LJ says that the point would operate in bar of the proceedings ""once the point was taken by the Home Office"". But that did not mean that only the Home Office could take the point: it simply reflected the fact that in the two cases before the court the Home Office had in fact taken the point. In any event there is an air of unreality in the suggestion that, if the tribunal takes the point, the Home Office does not. In the first place, the Home Office may not be represented before the tribunal; in that event it would border on the absurd to say that the tribunal cannot take the point of its own motion. If the Home Office is represented (as it was in this case), the representative will naturally permit the tribunal to make the running. If the appellant fails to persuade the tribunal that it has jurisdiction, it would again border on the absurd for the tribunal to have specifically to ask the Home Office representative if he wants to object to its jurisdiction to hear the appeal and to wait for an affirmative answer. If the Home Office does not think it fair or right to take the point it can always say so (and in a case such as Anwar it may have a public law duty to say so) and the tribunal can then proceed. 32. Mr Ockelton also thought (para 47(c)) it wrong to say that a failure to consider the issue of jurisdiction can give a tribunal a jurisdiction it would not otherwise have. Anwar does not so say. What it does say is that the Secretary of State can choose not to take any jurisdictional objection if she wishes to take that course, just as a defendant can waive his entitlement to plead limitation or, more likely, choose not to plead a limitation defence. If a tribunal gives a decision without anybody considering the jurisdictional position, the decision may be precarious but as Mr Ockelton himself points out in para 53 the decision stands until set aside. It will become less precarious once the time for applying for permission to appeal has expired. 33. Mr Ockelton also pointed out (para 47(a)) that there was no consideration in Anwar of the terms of the Secretary of State's Notice of Decision. In the present case the Notice of Decision does expressly say that Mr Nirula had a right of appeal which he could exercise ""After removal"". Mr Ockelton considered that, if it was necessary for the Secretary of State to take the jurisdiction point, she had taken it then. For my part, I agree with that conclusion but that does not in any way influence my decision that the jurisdiction point can be taken by the tribunal just as much as by the Secretary of State. 34. I would therefore reject Mr Malik's submission that the Secretary of State had herself to take the jurisdictional point and would hold that it was open to the FTT itself to do so. It made the correct decision on the point since it was clear that Mr Nirula was not abroad – he was actually in the room at the appeal hearing.” In the light of Nirula, it is, therefore, plain that, regardless of what occurred (or, more to the point, did not occur) at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal is entitled to take the “jurisdiction” point and that, if we conclude the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal under the 2016 Regulations, this was an error of law. Neither Mr Jarvis nor Mr Amunwa sought to argue the contrary. Instead, the claimant’s case for saying that the First-tier Tribunal did have jurisdiction rests upon the judgment of Michael Fordham QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, in BXS v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 737 (Admin). BXS concerned the effect of regulation 24A of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, which provided as follows:- “24A (1) A deportation or exclusion order shall remain in force unless it is revoked by the Secretary of State under this regulation. (2) A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion order may apply to the Secretary of State to have it revoked if the person considers that there been a material change in the circumstances that justified the making of the order. (3) An application under paragraph (2) shall set out the material change in circumstances relied upon by the applicant and may only be made whilst the applicant is outside the United Kingdom. (4) On receipt of an application under paragraph (2), the Secretary of State shall revoke the order if the Secretary of State considers that the criteria for making such an order are no longer satisfied. (5) The Secretary of State shall take a decision on an application under paragraph (2) no later than six months after the date on which the application is received.” Regulation 27(1) of the 2006 Regulations provided that: - “(1) … a person may not appeal under regulation 26 whilst he is in the United Kingdom against an EEA decision - … to refuse to revoke a deportation order made against him.” The following provisions of the judgment of the deputy judge are relevant for our purposes: - “23. If, … the uncompromising language of Regulation 24A, which describes an exclusive route of revocation under its provisions and requires that an application must be out of country, were incompatible either with EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights, then I would have no hesitation in concluding that that uncompromising effect could not lawfully be visited on a claimant for whom it would be such a violation. Whether by reading in words or reading the provision down, there would in my judgment be no difficulty in arriving at that conclusion. There are no clear words of primary legislation (for the purposes of section 3 of the Human Rights Act) that would mandate the maintenance of the otherwise uncompromising shape of Regulation 24A.” 24. What arises in the present case is a question as to whether the mere act of removing an individual pursuant to an EEA deportation order, so that they are placed in the position envisaged by Regulation 24A, is of itself a violation of their human rights. It is not difficult to think of examples where that action would plainly be a violation of human rights. The fact that the regulations permit the individual from abroad to apply for the deportation order to be revoked may very well be a good and perhaps a complete answer in most case when considering the implications of the ongoing exclusionary effect of a deportation order. But one can suppose examples of an individual who is not fit to fly, or examples of an individual whose family life will necessarily be harmed by the action of removing them, or by the necessary period of exclusion from the United Kingdom while they make the envisaged out of country application or pursue an out of country appeal. Circumstances of that nature can be envisaged in which that action of itself could constitute a violation of Convention rights. That being so, if Regulation 24A stood alone and were exhaustive of all remedies and rights of the individual, then there would, in my judgment, be an incompatibility with the human rights protections guaranteed by the Human Rights Act. In such a case, as it seems to me, the Secretary of State would only be acting consistently with her statutory human rights duty (under section 6 of the Human Rights Act) where the removal, of itself, could be said to be consistent with and not to violate those applicable human rights. That does lead to two conclusions. … 54. As for in-country appeal or out of country appeal, in my judgment, it must follow that if revocation can lawfully and justifiably be required to be pursued out of country, then it follows that insistence that any consequential appeal be out of country can also be justified. I ought to add that, in fact, as it happens, the out of country appeal position was already part of the EEA regime, not only from 2006 but, in fact, going to the previous Regulations of 2000. I ought also to add, in the context of appeal rights, that parliament has in section 109 of the 2002 Act recognised that different appeal provisions have been made in EEA cases than in non-EEA. None of that, of course, was to empower the making of provisions that were contrary to Convention rights. … 56. My answer to issue 1 then, for all those reasons, is that there is no incompatibility, either in EU or Human Rights Act terms, in the insistence, leaving aside the narrow human rights point which I have analysed, the insistence on an application for revocation based on change of circumstances and human rights and an appeal being pursued out of country, even though they would not be in a non EEA case. … 59. I ought to make it clear, at this point, that I do not accept the submission that the decision of 19 March 2013 was of itself an unlawful one in the light of the now recognised relevance that article 8 can have for a removal. The same is true of the letter of 28 March 2013 from UKBA. It is right that the Secretary of State was not at that stage considering the article 8 implications of the mere act of removal. Moreover, I have held that that is a proper human rights argument which an individual must always be entitled to raise and which engages the Secretary of State's section 6 Human Rights Act duty. However, the fact in this case is that the claimant's solicitors very clearly were invoking as the relevant provision, regulation 24A, and were inviting a revocation based on material change in the circumstances. In circumstances where that contention was rejected and in which I have held that the regulation which requires the application to be out of country is compatible both with EU and ECHR law, and in circumstances where the Secretary of State came later in the decision 15 November 2013 to grapple with article 18 and the question of removal, there is no ground on which the court could be justified in intervening. Nor, in my judgment, could there be any utility in the point so as to justify relief.” The Upper Tribunal accepts the submissions of Mr Jarvis, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that it is not possible to extract from the judgment in BXS any support for the proposition that, as a general matter, regulation 37(1)(d) of the 2016 Regulations should be somehow “read down”, so as to enable the present claimant to prosecute an appeal under those Regulations whilst he is in the United Kingdom. What concerned the deputy judge was the fact that there might be circumstances in which the mere fact of removal could violate Article 8 of the ECHR. As Mr Jarvis pointed out, however, regulation 33 of the 2016 Regulations requires the Secretary of State, when giving directions for removal, to turn his mind specifically to that issue, in circumstances where the individual concerned has not appealed against the EEA decision, but would be entitled to do so and remains within time to do so, from within the United Kingdom; or where the individual has so appealed but the appeal has not been finally determined. In the claimant’s case, the decision to remove by way of deportation was taken in 2017, when he was in the United Kingdom. The claimant did not challenge that decision. Furthermore and in any event, we have seen that the decision letter in the claimant’s case separately addressed the claimant’s submissions by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. The letter thus comprised two separate decisions; namely, a decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order and a decision to refuse the claimant’s human rights claim. Section 82(1)(b) gives a person a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal where the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights claim made by that person. Section 84(2) provides that the ground of appeal is that removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Accordingly, the claimant was entitled, through the mechanism of the human rights appeal, to contend that his removal would violate Article 8, including (if it were the position) that the mere fact of his removal would constitute such a violation, irrespective of the outcome of his out of country appeal under the 2016 Regulations. In the light of paragraphs 29 to 39 above, we conclude that the First-tier Tribunal judge did not have jurisdiction to determine the claimant’s appeal under the 2016 Regulations and that he erred in law in purporting to do so. The notice of appeal filed in August 2018 was of no effect. We set aside the judge’s decision in respect of the 2016 Regulations and remake it by substituting a decision formally dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction. H. The human rights appeal For the reasons we have just given, the First-tier Tribunal judge was, in fact, seized of an appeal under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. That is accepted by Mr Jarvis and also by his colleague, Mr Wilding, in the latter’s skeleton argument of 12 February 2019. The position is, accordingly, exactly that hypothesised by Sales LJ at paragraph 30 of Amirteymour v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 353, albeit by reference to the previous legislative regime: “Depending on the facts, if the Secretary of State did happen to address Article 8 arguments in her decision letter in such a case, it might be possible to say that the Secretary of State had waived the requirement for an application form to be completed in respect of her exercise of her residual discretion under the 1971 Act by reference to Article 8 and that she had then made two decisions, an “EEA decision” in relation to entitlements under the EEA Regulations and an “immigration decision” within the scope of section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, with distinct rights of appeal under regulation 26(1) and under section 82(1) respectively……..” It would be desirable if, henceforth, the Secretary of State were to make it plain in decision letters of the present kind that he is not only deciding an application by reference to 2016 Regulations but also refusing a human rights claim under section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. Such an approach may well have assisted the parties and the judge in the present case. As we have noted, the claimant’s grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal included a specific reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. That could only be taken as a challenge to the passages of the Secretary of State’s decision letter, where article 8 was expressly and extensively considered. Section 86(2)(a) imposes a duty on the First-tier Tribunal to determine any matter raised as a ground of appeal. At paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, however, the judge “did not go on to consider Article 8” in the light of his findings in respect of the 2016 Regulations. (a) Did the judge make a decision? Before us, there was some discussion as to whether paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision constituted a decision for the purposes of section 11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. This provision confers a right of appeal “on any point of law arising from a decision made by the First-tier Tribunal other than an excluded decision”. Mr Jarvis indicated that the Secretary of State might wish to reserve his position on this matter. With respect to Mr Jarvis, the answer is, in our view, manifest. In paragraph 27, the First-tier Tribunal judge was making a decision not to consider Article 8. That was a decision in violation of the obligation placed upon the Tribunal by section 84 of the 2002 Act. It would, we find, be highly undesirable if the position were otherwise. If a judge’s refusal to decide a human rights appeal cannot be categorised as a decision within the scope of section 11(1) of the 2007 Act, the only remedy will be judicial review. As the present case shows, such as a bifurcation of routes of challenge would give rise to complexity, delay and expense. It cannot have been Parliament’s intention, in enacting the 2007 Act, to bring about such a state of affairs. (b) Challenging the judge’s decision Having said this, how should the claimant have sought to challenge the decision in paragraph 27? Here, attention focuses on rule 24 (response to the notice of appeal) of the 2008 Rules. So far as relevant, this provides as follows: - “24. … (1)(A) Subject to any direction given by the Upper Tribunal, a respondent may provide a response to a notice of appeal. (2) Any response provided under paragraph (1A) must be in writing and must be sent or delivered to the Upper Tribunal so that it is received. (a) if an application for permission to appeal stands as the notice of appeal, (which it does here) no later than 1 month after the date on which the Respondent was sent notice that permission to appeal had been granted; … (3) The response must state - … (e) the grounds on which the respondent relies, including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another tribunal), any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely in the appeal; and … "" In EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal had before it a case in which the claimants had succeeded in the First-tier Tribunal on Article 3 grounds, by reason of them facing a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to Ethiopia, but where the First-tier Tribunal had dismissed their appeals on asylum grounds, on the basis that the claimants were excluded from the benefits of the Refugee Convention (and, likewise, from those of the Qualification Directive). The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission to appeal against the decision to allow the appeal on Article 3 grounds, following which the claimants filed responses under rule 24, in which they contended that their appeals should have been allowed under the Refugee Convention etc. The Upper Tribunal found as follows: - “33. Mr Eicke said that we have no power except that given us by statute and so we have no power to hear an appeal without permission. Parliament says unequivocally that a right may be exercised only with permission (2007 Act section 13(3)). An application can only be made in writing (First-tier Tribunal Rules, rule 24(1)) and an application for permission cannot be entertained by the Upper Tribunal unless an application has been made first to the First-tier Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Rules 21(2)(b)). Mr Eicke said that it made no sense for provisions that required permission to be obtained before a hearing in writing from a First-tier Judge to be swept aside and replaced by a system that enabled a respondent to an appeal to assert as of right arguments that were raised by the respondent in a notice of appeal which could otherwise only be raised with permission given in response to a written application. 34 Miss Dubinsky contended that appeal rights cannot be lightly displaced but we agree with Mr Eicke that we cannot give ourselves jurisdiction we do not have and it is not for us to create a right of appeal without permission. The claimants cannot appeal the decision of the First-tier Tribunal because they do not have permission to appeal and the Upper Tribunal has no power to give permission to appeal unless the First-tier Tribunal has refused permission (rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). 35. It does not follow from this that there are no circumstances when claimants would be unable to argue that any of the findings adverse to the respondent are wrong or that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by not allowing the appeal for more reasons than it did but the claimants cannot rely on rule 24 notices as an alternative to seeking permission to appeal. 36. Mr Eicke submitted that a rule 24 Notice was analogous to a Respondent’s Notice under rule 52 of the Civil Procedure Rules. There a party that is seeking permission to appeal from the appeal court must ask for permission and a party that (alternatively) wishes to ask the appeal court to uphold the order of the lower court for reasons different from or additional to those given by the lower court must give notice of that intention. His point was that the need for permission to cross-appeal was well understood in civil proceedings and seeking it was not something that the respondent to an appeal in the Upper Tribunal could be expected to ignore. 37. In many ways the provisions of rule 52 of the CPR are analogous to a rule 24 Notice but they are not the same. Under rule 52.3(2) of the CPR a party that does not have permission to appeal from the lower courts can seek it from the higher court but in the civil courts the failure to secure permission from the lower court (even if through culpable neglect) can be remedied by the higher court but the failure to seek permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal cannot be corrected by the Upper Tribunal. The First-tier Tribunal must decide a written application for permission to appeal before the Upper Tribunal can be involved (see rule 24(1) of the 2005 Rules and rule 21(2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules). This is a cumbersome procedure once proceedings have begun before the Upper Tribunal. An application in writing can be made at any stage, and a judge deciding a case in the Upper Tribunal could no doubt withdraw and determine a written application for permission to appeal as a judge of the First-tier Tribunal. However if the judge did not extend time (for such an application would almost always be very late) or refused permission to appeal there would no doubt be an application for an adjournment so that the papers could be put before a judge sitting the Upper Tribunal. This, we find, must be the deliberate intention of the rules and rather underlines the importance of a party that needs permission to appeal seeking it in accordance with the prescribe time scales and well before a rule 24 notice would ordinarily be appropriate. 38. Against this background we look carefully at the terms of rule 24 of the Upper Tribunal Rules. Although the rule prescribes a time scale for providing a respondent’s notice and prescribes its contents, the rule does not create a general obligation on a respondent to provide a notice at all. Rather if the respondent chooses to send a notice then rule 24 prescribes its content. In this case directions echo the rule and specify the contents of a Notice rather than insist on one being served. 39. Certain of the requirements are informative rather than controversial, such as stating the respondent’s name and address, whether the respondent wants a hearing and, usefully, whether or not the respondent opposes the appeal. Rule 24(3)(e), it was submitted, assists the appellant. It requires the respondent to state in the response: “The grounds on which the respondent relies including (in the case of an appeal against the decision of another Tribunal) any grounds on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal, but intends to rely on in the appeal.” 40. The 2002 Act provides statutory grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (see section 84(1)) but the Secretary of State can never appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and so cannot rely strictly on the grounds listed at section 84(1) which are all grounds of appeal against an immigration decision. It follows that “grounds” in rule 24 must have a wider meaning and include any reason relied upon by the parties to support the decision. It does not follow that a respondent can raise a point in a response that should have been raised in the respondent’s own appeal. 41. Ms Dubinsky argued that the rule 24 response permitted her to argue, without seeking permission to appeal, that the First-tier Tribunal should have resolved any point in the claimant’s favour that the claimant relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that this rule is incapable of being interpreted in a way that does not assume that a respondent can challenge a First-tier Tribunal’s decision in this manner without permission to appeal having been granted. Ms Dubinsky argued that a respondent who opposes an appeal can be expected, without need for express confirmation, to rely on grounds which were successful before the First-tier Tribunal. It would hardly be informative for an appellant before the First-tier Tribunal who succeeded in persuading the First-tier Tribunal (for example) that a decision was not in accordance with the immigration rules (section 84(1)(a)) to be required to state in a notice that it relied on the same successful ground when responding to an appeal brought by the Secretary of State and the rule makes no such requirement. Rule 24(3)(e) requires the respondent to state if it intends to rely on grounds that were unsuccessful “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” but intends to rely on in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Ms Dubinsky submitted that the rule does not make sense unless it is interpreted to mean, without qualification, that there is a right to say that a ground that was unsuccessful before the First-tier Tribunal should have succeeded. 42. When Mr Eicke addressed us on rule 24(3)(e) he tried to circumvent Ms Dubinsky’s submission by emphasising that the claimants were required to identify any grounds on which they intended to rely including grounds “on which the respondent was unsuccessful in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal”. He said that the words “which are the subject of the appeal” are crucial. The proceedings which are the subject of the appeal were not, he submitted, all the proceedings that were before the First-tier Tribunal, but only the proceedings that were before us and the proceedings before us, were identified by reference to the grant of permission to appeal. Clearly, if he is right, the points relied on by the claimants are excluded because they were not part of that grant. 43. The bright line distinction between the First-tier section 85 appeal and the Upper Tier section 11 appeal suggested by Mr Eicke’s argument is inconsistent with the continuum suggested by section 104(4) of the 2002 Act and by rule 17A of the Upper Tribunal Rules. A section 11 appeal does not continue when a section 85 appeal has been abandoned. Similarly a section 11 appeal does not exist without regard to the section 85 appeal that encapsulated the dispute between the parties. In some ways this is an unattractive line of argument. It follows that we do not accept that the words “in the proceedings which are the subject of the appeal” are limited to the grounds on which permission to appeal has been given. The “proceedings” that are the “subject of the appeal” are those that came before the First-tier Tribunal and it is those “proceedings” that are the subject to further appeal. 44. Ms Dubinsky’s contention that rule 24 is meaningless unless it permits raising any points that failed to impress the First-tier Tribunal, including a point that should have been the subject of an appeal, is attractive but is, we find, wrong. 45. Although section 11 of the 2007 Act extends the right of appeal (with permission and subject to excluded decisions) to an appeal “on any point of law” save for extraordinary cases, a party will not normally be given permission to appeal, and will not be expected to seek permission to appeal, a point that would not make a material difference to the outcome. However that party might still have very good reasons to respond to an appeal by arguing that the First-tier Tribunal should have dismissed or allowed the appeal for reasons other than those given in the Determination or rather for grounds which were unsuccessful in the proceedings that are the subject of the appeal. 46. Suppose a man seeks entry clearance as a husband and suppose that the Entry Clearance Officer finds that he has not shown that he can be either accommodated or maintained in accordance with the rules. A First-tier Tribunal Judge may decide, arguably wrongly, that the husband can satisfy the accommodation requirements but not the maintenance requirements. In that event the judge would dismiss the appeal. The Entry Clearance Office would have no interest in appealing. He is content with the decision to dismiss the appeal. The husband however may want to challenge the decision. He might want to argue that the decision that he did not satisfy the maintenance requirements was wrong in law and he may be given permission to appeal. In that event the Entry Clearance Officer may well want to argue not only that the decision that the husband did not meet the maintenance requirements was right but that the decision that he did meet the accommodation requirements was wrong. In short, without wanting to appeal the decision, the Entry Clearance Officer may want to rely on a ground that failed before the First-tier Tribunal. Rule 24 permits the Entry Clearance Office to give notice of his intention to raise such a point in a reply. In short rule 24 does have a meaning that does not depend on Ms Dubinsky’s premise and we reject the construction that she urged on us. Rule 24 does not create a right of appeal to a party who has not asked for permission to appeal. Rule 24 is not in any way to do with seeking permission to appeal and it is not an alternative to seeking permission where permission is needed. It is to do with giving notice about how the respondent intends to respond to the appeal that the appellant has permission to pursue. If a respondent wants to argue that the First-tier Tribunal should have reached a materially different conclusion then the respondent needs permission to appeal. 47. This is probably more significant in international protection cases than entry clearance cases because an appeal can be allowed on different grounds. An appellant may have shown, for example, alternatively, that he is a refugee, or entitled to humanitarian protection or that removal is contrary to his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The beneficial consequences of success would be different in each case. For example a person found to be entitled to humanitarian protection may want to argue that he should have been recognised as a refugee whilst the Secretary of State may want to argue that the appeal should only have been allowed with reference to article 8. In such cases both parties would want a result materially different from the one decided by the Tribunal and both should seek permission to appeal.” We must respectfully take issue with paragraph 37 of EG. Despite the mandatory nature of rule 21(2) of the 2008 Rules, there is no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly) or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7 (failure to comply with rules etc), so far as relevant provides: - “7.(1) An irregularity resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, does not of itself render void the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings.” (2) If a party has failed to comply with a requirement in these Rules, a practice direction or a direction, the Upper Tribunal may take such action as it considers just, which may include - (a) waiving the requirement; …” In Ved and another (appealable decision; permission application; Basnet) [2014] UKUT 00150 (IAC), the appellants applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal against a decision that their appeals to that Tribunal were not valid. The First-tier Tribunal refused to entertain the applications. The appellants then applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. The Upper Tribunal held that even though, for the purposes of rule 21(2)(b), the First-tier Tribunal had not refused, or refused to admit, the application for permission to appeal, it was appropriate to apply rule 7(2) so as to waive that requirement and enable the appellants to apply for permission direct to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal held as follows: - “24. On the particular facts of the present case, the requirement in rule 21(2), that the appellant should have applied for permission to the First-tier Tribunal and been refused or had their application not admitted, clearly should not be a reason to preclude the appellants from applying for permission to the Upper Tribunal. We would, however, emphasise the following important points. 25. … the existence of rule 7(2)(a) is not in any way to be regarded as excusing appellants from first applying to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal, before approaching the Upper Tribunal. Indeed, we cannot readily envisage a situation where the Upper Tribunal would be likely to accept an application for permission from a party to proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal who has chosen not to make any prior application to that Tribunal, whether or not such an application would be out of time. The same is likely to be true where no such prior application is made, as a result of inadvertence.” Although it is necessary to make that caveat to paragraph 37 of EG, the point made in paragraph 25 of Ved holds good, in the particular circumstances with which EG was concerned. The Upper Tribunal is very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a person who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that body seeks to challenge that adverse decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of the first-mentioned person. So far as the present case is concerned, we consider that the key question is what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” in paragraph 46 of EG. There is, we find, considerable force in Mr Amunwa’s submission that, in the case of the claimant, there was no material benefit to him in applying for permission to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge (as we find it to be) not to determine his human rights appeal, given that, on the face of the judge’s decision, the claimant had succeeded in resisting removal by reference to the 2016 Regulations. As a general matter, it would be undesirable if individuals were encouraged to seek permission to appeal against adverse decisions which, if decided differently, would confer upon them no tangible benefit, given the decision in their favour. The litigation of what in most circumstances would be academic issues is not in the interests of the overriding objective. In EG, the appellants would plainly have been in a materially better legal position, if they had been found by the First-tier Tribunal to have the status of refugees within the scope of the Refugee Convention, rather than persons who could not, for the present, be removed without a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment. They would have enjoyed the benefits of that Convention. We do not consider that the answer to the question of what is meant by “a materially different conclusion” necessarily turns upon whether (as here) two distinct appeals are in play. A paradigm instance exists in section 82 of the 2002 Act, where subsection (1)(a) confers a right of appeal against the decision to refuse protection claim, whilst subsection (1)(b) confers such a right in respect of the refusal of a human rights claim. A person who succeeds in a protection claim, on the basis that he or she is found to be a refugee or a person entitled to the grant of humanitarian protection, may have been unsuccessful in a human rights appeal brought by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR. In such circumstances, there would be nothing to be gained by seeking permission to appeal in respect of the Article 8 human rights decision of the Tribunal. We accordingly conclude that the test of materiality, as articulated in EG and as further explained above, remains the correct touchstone in respect of the appellate system contained in the 2002 Act (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014) and in the 2016 Regulations. In the present case, therefore, the claimant was entitled to raise, in his rule 24 response, the Article 8 grounds on which he had been unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. That means it was unnecessary for those advising the claimant to couch this aspect of the response in terms of a “cross appeal”, with all the attendant procedural complexity that an application for permission to appeal would, at that stage, entail. It may be helpful to set out our general conclusions under this Part: (i) A decision by the First-tier Tribunal not to decide a ground of appeal constitutes a ""decision"" for the purposes of s.11(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. It may therefore be appealed to the Upper Tribunal. (ii) If an appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal succeeds on some grounds and fails on other grounds, the appellant will not be required to apply for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in respect of any ground on which he or she failed, so long as a determination of that ground in the appellant’s favour would not have conferred on the appellant any material (ie tangible) benefit, compared with the benefit flowing from the ground or grounds on which the appellant was successful in the First-tier Tribunal. (iii) In the event that the respondent to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal obtains permission to appeal against that Tribunal’s decision regarding the grounds upon which the First-tier Tribunal found in favour of the appellant, then, ordinarily, the appellant will be able to rely upon rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008 Rules in order to argue in a response that the appellant should succeed on the grounds on which he or she was unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal. Any such response must be filed and served in accordance with those Rules and the Upper Tribunal’s directions. (iv) If permission to appeal is required, any application for permission should be made to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with rule 33 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, within the time limits there set out. This includes cases where the appellant has succeeded on some grounds but failed on others, in respect of which a material benefit would flow (see (ii) above). (v) There is, however, no jurisdictional fetter on the Upper Tribunal entertaining an application for permission to appeal, even though the condition contained in rule 21(2)(b) of the 2008 Rules has not been met, in that the First-tier Tribunal has not refused (wholly or partly), or has not refused to admit, an application for permission to appeal made to that Tribunal. Rule 7(2)(a) of the 2008 Rules permits the Upper Tribunal to waive any failure to comply with a requirement of the Rules. The guidance in EG and NG (UT rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24: Scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) is otherwise confirmed. (vi) The Upper Tribunal is, nevertheless, very unlikely to be sympathetic to a request that it should invoke rule 7(2)(a), where a party (A), who could and should have applied for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against an adverse decision of that Tribunal, seeks to challenge that decision only after the other party has been given permission to appeal against a decision in the same proceedings which was in favour of A. (c) Disposal of the human rights appeal As will be apparent, once it is determined that the claimant can use rule 24 to challenge paragraph 27 of the First-tier Tribunal judge’s decision, that challenge must succeed. So much is common ground between the parties. The judge failed to make a lawful decision on the claimant’s appeal against the refusal of his human rights claim. The judge’s error was, in the circumstances, material. The decision in the human rights appeal is set aside and requires to be re-made. We have seen that, before the First-tier Tribunal judge, it was contended on behalf of the Secretary of State that the issue of whether the claimant could prove on balance that he is a British citizen was one which had to be resolved by judicial review proceedings. We did not hear submissions on what relevance, if any, the claimant’s assertion of British citizenship will have to his unresolved human rights appeal. A person who asserts that his or her removal would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and whose circumstances engage Article 8(2) of the ECHR, must succeed if the challenged decision is not one which can lawfully be made in respect of that person: Charles (Human Rights Appeal: Scope) [2018] UKUT 89 (IAC). At first sight, therefore, the issue of the claimant’s nationality may not be capable of being side-stepped. On the other hand, section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 entitles the Secretary of State to qualify the right of those who have the right of abode to live in and come and go into and from the United Kingdom, to the extent that “may be required … to enable their right to be established or as may be otherwise lawfully imposed on any person”. The Secretary of State might, therefore, contend that he is entitled to have an application for recognition as a British citizen determined in a particular manner, so as to resist its adjudication within the framework of a human rights appeal. This issue is one which requires adjudication at Upper Tribunal level. We have accordingly decided to re-make the decision in claimant’s human rights appeal. The parties are hereby directed to address this issue in their skeleton arguments, which shall be filed and served not later than 14 days before the resumed hearing. I. Anonymity Upper Tribunal Judge Gill’s directions required the parties to make submissions as to anonymity of the claimant. We have considered the parties’ submissions. We find that the First-tier Tribunal judge was wrong to order anonymity and we lift his order. The judge’s reasons were that he considered it “in the interests of justice” to make an anonymity direction. (paragraph 2). The judge provided no explanation of why he had reached this conclusion. The starting point is that open justice is a fundamental principle of our legal system. Any derogation from that principle should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary in order to secure the proper administration of justice. As a result, just as is the case in other jurisdictions, the parties in immigration proceedings should be named, unless doing so would cause harm, or create the risk of harm, of such a nature as to require derogation from the basic principle. In most cases involving international protection, anonymity of an individual will be required, lest the proceedings themselves should aggravate or give rise to such a risk. That will normally be the case throughout the course of the proceedings, including any appeals. Applying the correct approach to the present case, we note the claimant has a partner, who was pregnant at the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal judge. The partner is not named in this decision. We are not satisfied that the claimant has shown that naming him in our decision would give rise to any material harm to the partner or any other third party. The claimant would, no doubt, prefer it if our decision did not refer to him by name. He is not, however, asserting a risk of harm to himself, as in the case of a person seeking international protection. Irrespective of whether the Article 8 rights of the claimant or any other person are in due course found to be of such a kind as to defeat the Secretary of State’s attempt to remove the claimant, the public has a right to know about the criminal behaviour of the claimant, which led to the decision that he should be deported. There is also a strong public interest in recording the fact that the claimant has repeatedly behaved in flagrant contravention of what is, on its face, a valid deportation order. The claimant’s request for anonymity is refused. J. Decision The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of errors on points of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the appeal under the 2016 Regulations is set aside and re-made by formally dismissing it. The decision in the appeal against the refusal of the claimant’s human rights claim is set aside and will be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. Signed Date: 24 June 2019 The Hon.

For the Respondent: Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. DECISION AND REASONS The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on 1 September 1977, appeals, with permission granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J M Hollingworth (hereafter the “permission judge”), against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke (hereafter the “judge”, to distinguish her from the permission judge) who dismissed his appeal against the respondent's decision of 14 November 2018 to refuse his application of 27 July 2016 for leave to remain on the basis of his right to his private life in the United Kingdom. The hearing before the judge took place on 22 January 2019. In AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal (Lane J, President, and Upper Tribunal Judge Blum) gave guidance on when it would be appropriate to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a ground that was not advanced by the applicant. The decision in AZ was published on 21 September 2018. The permission judge signed his decision on 3 April 2019. He therefore had the benefit of the guidance in AZ. Immigration history The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2007 with leave as a student. He had leave as a student from 13 April 2007 until 30 April 2011 and from 21 January 2015 until 18 February 2016. On 17 March 2016, he made an application for leave to remain on compassionate grounds outside the Immigration Rules. The application was refused on 20 July 2016 without a right of appeal. On 27 July 2016, he requested the respondent to reconsider his application on human rights grounds. This is the request that was the subject of the decision of 14 November 2018 which gave the appellant a right of appeal. The judge's decision An expert report from Dr Bashir, Consultant Psychiatrist, was submitted to the judge. The report stated that the appellant had suffered from severe clinical depression. Ms Ukachi-Lois, who appeared for the appellant before the judge, informed the judge that she did not rely upon the appellant’s ill-health. However, the judge said ([5]) that some references were made to it during submissions. The judge considered the appellant’s private life claim under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules and concluded that he had not shown that there would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria. She noted that the appellant relied upon his lack of family members in Nigeria, his inability to accommodate and maintain himself if he was returned, and that he had suffered mental ill-health previously. In relation to the appellant's mental health, the judge noted ([7]) that Dr Bashir stated that the appellant suffered from severe clinical depression but she also noted that the diagnosis was not made with reference to any criteria. She noted that the appellant was referred back to his GP and that the medical evidence showed that he was last prescribed setraline on 21 May 2018. In addition, she noted that the appellant was not making a case based upon medical issues. In relation to the appellant’s claim that he would experience very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria because he had no family members in Nigeria and that he would be unable to accommodate and maintain himself in Nigeria, the judge took his case at its highest, on the assumption that he had no family members in Nigeria. She said, (at [8]-[9]): “8. The Appellant left his country in 2007 and if taking his case at its highest, and there are no family members there, and the house of the great uncle is not available to him now the uncle has died and the family members have locked it up, I go on to consider if he could return as a single male. 9. The Appellant came to the UK to study on [sic] the ACCA but did not complete the professional level because of ill-health. He told me he would like to complete his studies and I see no reason why he could not return to his country and either continue his studies there or make an out of country application to continue in the UK if this is what he so wishes. The aunt houses and maintains him and she said it would be too costly for her to continue to maintain him if he returned to Nigeria and lived there and for her to pay for his studies. I note the Appellant and his aunt appear not to have considered the option of him returning to his country and taking some form of employment to maintain himself. I was told by both witnesses there are no jobs but there is no objective evidence to show he could not obtain some work, and in the initial months the aunt who has around £100,000 in savings and is drawing her pensions as well as working as a nurse on around two shifts a week and earning around £2000 a month is well-placed to assist him financially when he returns to settle in his country.” (My emphasis) The judge was asked to accept that the appellant lives with his aunt, Ms Theresa Chinyere Odum, in the United Kingdom in a family relationship. She also took this aspect of his case at its highest, and said, at [10]-[11]: “10. I was invited to accept the Appellant lives with the aunt in a family relationship, because she maintains and accommodates him and there is more than emotional dependency. Taking the case at its highest, if there is a family life and it would be interfered with if he returns to Nigeria, the aunt is from Nigeria and is now a British Citizen, but she returned there in 2017 for a funeral, and it would be proportionate for the Appellant to be removed to Nigeria because they could continue their relationship at a distance with her maintaining and accommodating him until he settles on his own feet. She can also provide emotional assistance to ease the transition and she can visit him as well. 11. I accept the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but he is now not suffering from such issues. He attends a church almost daily, but there are churches in Nigeria to attend and there is nothing to prevent him from such regular attendance there outside his work hours. The community of a church would also ease his transition to independence.” The judge then considered s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and proportionality. She said, at [12]-[13]: “12. The Appellant speaks English and I accept has been maintained by the aunt. However, he remained in the UK after his leave to remain expired, and he was not studying, and I do not accept his explanation for so remaining. He could have returned to his country and made another out of country application if he so wished. The Appellant only had precarious leave at best and has built up his private life when he had precarious leave. The Appellant has made a number of applications which were not successful since his refusal on 2 April 2013 with a right of appeal granted. 13. Therefore, drawing the strands together, the Appellant can return to his country where he lived until he was 29 years old. He has the benefit of some financial assistance from his aunt to ease him back to establishing himself before he can accommodate and maintain himself and he would not deplete her savings, and if he wishes he can continue to reside in his country or make another Tier 4 application to further his studies in the UK if he obtains the necessary offer from a suitable educational establishment. At present, he has no such offer because he has no leave to remain. For these reasons, it is proportionate and in the public interest for the Appellant to be removed.” The grounds and the grant of permission The appellant’s written grounds advanced two grounds, as follows: (i) (Ground 1) The judge made findings on family life but failed to consider the impact of the respondent’s decision on the appellant's aunt, contrary to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKH 39. Furthermore, she failed to give reasons or any adequate reasons for her omission. (ii) (Ground 2) The judge made perverse or irrational findings on a material matter; specifically, her findings that the appellant's aunt was well placed to assist the appellant financially when he returns to settle in Nigeria and that she would not deplete her savings. The grounds contend that there was no legal basis for these findings. The grant of permission went beyond the grounds. As I will need to deal with the terms in which permission was granted, I quote the reasons given by the permission judge for granting permission: “At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant living with the aunt in a family relationship. It is arguable that the Judge has attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the Judge at paragraph 11. The Judge accepted that the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown but was now not suffering from such issues. It is arguable that the concept of real support fell to be considered against that background. It is arguable that the proportionality exercise has been affected in assessing the strength of family life and the consequences of the departure of the Appellant. At paragraph 12 the Judge accepted that the Appellant had been maintained by the aunt. At paragraph 9 of the decision the Judge has referred to the aunt stating that it will be too costly for her to continue to maintain the Appellant if he returned to Nigeria. It was arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis of the ability of the Appellant's aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria having proceeded at the conclusion of paragraph 9 to refer to the assets and income of the Appellant's aunt in evaluating that the Appellant's aunt would be well placed to assist the Appellant financially when he returned to settle in his country. It is arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis given the lack of reference to any obligations on the part of the Appellant's aunt or her financial commitments. At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred to the Appellant's aunt providing emotional assistance to ease the transition. It is arguable that if such emotional assistance was required to ease the transition a fuller analysis was required of the emotional assistance afforded to the Appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life.” (My emphasis) Submissions At the commencement of the hearing, I asked Ms Ukachi-Lois to draw my attention to the following: (i) the evidence that was before the judge to establish that family life was enjoyed between the appellant and his aunt; (ii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom; and (iii) the evidence that was before the judge to establish the financial commitments and obligations of the appellant's aunt. I pointed out to Ms Ukachi-Lois that, given that the aunt had stated that she had savings of £100,000, her evidence that it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant if he were to return to Nigeria plainly called for an explanation. Concerning (i), Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. She also referred me to the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. Concerning (ii) and (iii), Ms Ukachi-Lois read to me her notes of the oral evidence that the aunt gave before the judge. I checked this against the judge's manuscript record of the oral evidence of the aunt. As a result, it was clear (and Ms Ukachi-Lois agreed) that the oral evidence that the aunt gave concerning the impact on her of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom was as follows: She would struggle to afford to support the appellant financially. She also said: “My savings were for many years, Not able to support. Schools on strike. Transportation and feeding would be too stressful. I am only family. 2008, Dad died. No family in Nigeria”. In relation to ground 1, Ms Ukachi-Lois said that she was in difficulty because there was a lack of evidence before the judge concerning the impact on the appellant’s aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. However, she submitted that it is only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant’s case can be made. In relation to ground 2, Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that the judge's finding that it would not deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially if he returns to Nigeria was irrational. This was because it would deplete her savings, contrary to the judge's finding. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the judge had noted at [10] that she had been asked to accept that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt. She took this at its highest. There was a paucity of evidence of any substance before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure from the United Kingdom. At [12], the judge accepted that the appellant had been maintained by his aunt in the United Kingdom. She noted that there was no explanation for the appellant remaining in the United Kingdom once his leave had expired. At [8], the judge considered, at its highest, the appellant's claim that he has no family in Nigeria. Mr Clarke submitted that, given the case that was advanced before the judge and the evidence that was before her, ground 1 is simply not established. Mr Clarke submitted that ground 2 was a perversity challenge. i.e. that no properly directed Tribunal could reach the same conclusion on the basis of the evidence that was before the judge. It was not the case, as portrayed in the grounds, that the judge had made her decision on the basis that the appellant’s aunt would support the appellant indefinitely. In Mr Clarke’s submission, it was clear from [9] of the judge’s decision that she considered that the appellant would be able to obtain a job to maintain himself and that his aunt would only need to provide him with financial assistance in the initial months, whilst he settled down. Accordingly, he submitted that it was open to the judge to find that it would not deplete the savings of the appellant’s aunt if she were to provide the appellant with such financial assistance in the initial months. She was accommodating and maintaining him at present, in any event. Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that, if I were to set aside the judge's decision, the Upper Tribunal could re-make the decision on the appeal. However, given the paucity of the evidence that was before the judge, she requested that the appellant be given an opportunity to provide further evidence about his aunt's financial circumstances. I reserved my decision. Assessment Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence that was before the judge to establish that the appellant enjoyed family life with his aunt was the fact that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. It is clear from [10] that the judge decided the appellant's appeal taking his claim that he enjoyed family life with his aunt at its highest. She found that they could continue their relationship with each other at a distance. That finding was fully open to her, given the witness statement of the appellant’s aunt. She said in her witness statement that she brought the appellant to the United Kingdom in 2007, when he was 29/30 years old, so that he could study accountancy and achieve an ACCA qualification. Accordingly, their enjoyment of their relationship with each other over many years, from his birth until he was 29/30 years old, was from a distance. Ground 1, which contends that the judge had erred by failing to consider the impact on the appellant's aunt of his departure, cannot succeed because it was plain at the hearing before me that Ms Ukachi-Lois was in difficulty referring me to any evidence that was before the judge to establish the impact on the appellant's aunt. I have set out that evidence at my para 14 above. It is plain that the judge specifically considered, at [9], the aunt’s evidence that it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant in Nigeria and pay for his studies. She said that neither the appellant nor his aunt had considered the possibility of the appellant obtaining a job in Nigeria and that, although both witnesses told her that there were no jobs in Nigeria, there was no objective evidence to show that he could not obtain some work. I stress that, apart from the evidence set out at my para 14 above, which the judge considered at [9], there was simply no evidence before the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. The judge assessed such evidence as was before her. Ms Ukachi-Lois was relegated to submitting that it was only reasonable that there should be a further assessment of the impact on the appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment of the appellant's case can be made. However, the judge has made a fair assessment of such evidence as was before her. This submission just ignores the fact that the judge's decision can only be set aside if she has made an error on a point of law such that it should be set aside. I therefore reject ground 1. Ground 2 is likewise hopeless. It simply ignores the judge's reasoning, that there was no objective evidence that the appellant could not obtain some work in Nigeria and that, in the initial months, the aunt was well placed financially to assist him to settle in his country. Furthermore, and as I said at the hearing, the evidence of the appellant's aunt, that it would be too costly for her to maintain him and pay for his studies, plainly called for an explanation given that she had savings of £100,000. This is a large sum of money. Few people of ordinary means have access to such savings. Since it was for the appellant to establish his case, it was for him to provide evidence to show precisely why it would be too costly for his aunt to help him to settle down in Nigeria, whether or not he pursued his studies there, and that the financial cost of her doing so was such that the decision was disproportionate. It is clear that the aunt was not questioned in oral evidence to explain why she said it would be too costly for her to maintain the appellant, nor was she asked to give evidence of her liabilities and commitments. In her submissions at the hearing, all that Ms Ukachi-Lois could say in relation to ground 2 was that the judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted was irrational because it would deplete the aunt’s savings if she were to assist the appellant financially after he returned to Nigeria. However, the fact is that the judge found that there was no reason why the appellant would not be able to obtain a job in Nigeria and therefore that the aunt only needed to assist him financially in the initial period whilst he settled down. It is plain that she found, implicitly, that the aunt’s savings would not therefore reduce significantly. In reality, ground 2 amounts to no more than a disagreement with the judge's reasoning. The judge's finding that the aunt’s savings would not be depleted, cannot be said to be irrational, on any legitimate view. I therefore reject ground 2. I turn to consider the grounds upon which permission was granted. Plainly, the grant of permission went beyond the grounds. In summary, it raised three points that did not feature in the appellant's written grounds, as follows: (i) that the judge arguably attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship given the background referred to by the judge at [11]; (ii) that the judge arguably set out an insufficient analysis of the aunt’s financial position given the lack of reference to the aunt's obligations or her financial commitments; and (iii) that, if emotional assistance was required to ease the appellant’s ‘transition’ after his return to Nigeria, then arguably ""a fuller analysis was required"" of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life. In relation to point (i), the permission judge went on to draw from the facts as disclosed in the judge's decision to support his view that it was arguable that the judge had attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship, stating that it was arguable that the concept of “real support” fell to be construed against the background that the appellant had suffered from some sort of nervous breakdown in the past. The authorities are clear that, in an asylum or human rights case, a Tribunal must take a Robinson obvious point in the claimant's favour. The term Robinson obvious derives from the judgment in R v SSHD ex parte Robinson [1998] QB 929. A Robinson obvious point is one that has a strong prospect of success. In AZ, the Upper Tribunal discussed the relevant jurisprudence at [61]-[74] of its decision beginning with Robinson. In head-note (3), the Upper Tribunal said: “3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal should be granted on a ground that was not advanced by an applicant for permission, only if: (a) the judge is satisfied that the ground he or she has identified is one which has a strong prospect of success: (i) for the original appellant; or (ii) for the Secretary of State, where the ground relates to a decision which, if undisturbed, would breach the United Kingdom’s international Treaty obligations; or (b) (possibly) the ground relates to an issue of general importance, which the Upper Tribunal needs to address.” However, the permission judge did not indicate that the grounds he was raising came within head-note 3.(b) nor can it reasonably be said, on any legitimate view, that they did. Since the points he raised were not for the Secretary of State, head-note 3(a)(ii) is inapplicable. This leaves head-note para 3.(a)(i), a Robinson obvious point in the appellant's favour. However, as the Upper Tribunal said in AZ, it is clear from the authorities that mere arguability is not sufficient. A higher hurdle must be surmounted. The point in question has to be obvious, in the sense of being one with a strong prospect of success, were permission to be granted. Even at the permission stage, the question is whether the point in question has a strong prospect of success and not whether it is arguable that it has, as is clear from para 3(a) of the head-note in AZ. The judge's decision did not mention what evidence was before her concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt. As can be seen from my para 13 above, Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence was that the appellant and his aunt had lived together and that the aunt had supported the appellant when he had suffered from depression in the past. However, the judge was fully aware of this evidence and referred to it in her decision. There was no reason to think that she did not have it in mind when she considered proportionality. If there was relevant evidence concerning the strength of the relationship between the appellant and his aunt that the judge had overlooked, the expectation is that this would have been mentioned in the appellant's written grounds, whether or not he was represented. However, there was no suggestion in the appellant's written grounds that the judge had overlooked relevant evidence in this regard. It therefore appears that, in stating that the judge may have attached insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship and in referring to the need to consider the concept of “real support” in the context of the fact that the appellant had previously suffered a nervous breakdown, the permission judge in fact considered that the judge ought to have given more weight to the relationship than she did and to the fact that the appellant’s aunt had provided him with emotional support in the past when he suffered a nervous breakdown. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the permission judge was merely disagreeing with the reasoning of the judge. Furthermore, the authorities clearly establish that arguments as to weight do not ordinarily establish an error of law. Ms Ukachi-Lois (correctly, in my judgment) did not pursue point (i) at the hearing. It is plain that point (i) discloses no error of law in the decision of the judge. Point (ii) is that it is arguable that the judge had insufficiently analysed the ability of the appellant’s aunt to maintain him if he were to return to Nigeria given her failure to refer to the aunt's obligations and financial commitments. However, it was clear at the hearing before me, that there was simply no evidence before the judge of the financial obligations or commitments of the appellant's aunt. Furthermore, the aunt was not asked to explain precisely why she said it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant in Nigeria, which plainly called for an explanation in view of the amount of her savings, as I said at the hearing. Finally, point (iii) is that it is arguable that the judge had failed to give “a fuller analysis …. of the emotional assistance afforded to the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance of family life”. This is an empty point as exemplified by the fact that Ms Ukachi-Lois did not pursue it at the hearing. For all of the reasons given above, it is clear that the three points raised by the permission judge were not only hopeless, they could not on any reasonable view have been adjudged as arguable Robinson obvious points, i.e. with a strong prospect of success. For all of the reasons given above, the judge did not make any error of law. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed. Turning to the grant of permission in AZ, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Holmes raised an issue concerning the delay (of about eight months) between the date of the hearing and the preparation of the decision. He referred to two cases on delay in his grant of permission: Mario [1998] Imm AR 281 and Sambasivam [1999] OATRF 1999/0419/4. However, the Upper Tribunal considered ([71]) that Judge Holmes had not correctly identified the relevant case law and that, in particular, he had failed to have regard to the more recent Tribunal authority of Arusha and Demushi (deprivation of citizenship – delay) [2012] UKUT 80 (IAC) which relied upon the Court of Appeal's judgment in RK (Algeria) [2007] EWCA Civ 868. The Tribunal said this at [70]-[71]: “70. The basic point to be borne in mind is that there must be an extremely sound reason for, in effect, compelling the parties to an appeal to engage with a matter that neither of them has identified. 71. The present case is an object lesson in what can happen when this principle of restraint is not respected….” In AZ, the Tribunal said (at [72]) that far from it being a case in which the ground raised by Judge Holmes of his own volition was strongly arguable, it was not a ground at all. This can certainly be said of point (i) raised by the permission judge in the instant case, because issues going to weight rarely give rise to an error of law, as has been said on many occasions (for example, Blake J, the then President, in Green (Article 8 – new rules) [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC)). It is difficult to see what error of law the permission judge had in mind in relation to point (iii) above which was not even pursued by Ms Ukachi-Lois at the hearing. However, the position is even worse in relation to point (ii). This is because the evidence which necessarily would have had to have been adduced to the judge in order to make good this point had not even been adduced. There was simply no evidence before the judge which could have enabled her to conduct any analysis of the financial commitments of the appellant's aunt. At para 70 of AZ, the Tribunal said that there must be an extremely sound reason for compelling the parties to engage with a matter that neither had identified. In the instant case, two of the three points were not even pursued at the hearing and one could not be established because the evidence necessary to establish the point was simply not before the judge. It is important to bear in mind that a grant of permission when it is not properly warranted wastes the limited resources of the Upper Tribunal, puts the parties to unnecessary expense, delays bringing finality to the case in question and contributes to delaying the disposition of other meritorious cases. It is therefore necessary to exercise self-restraint, as the Tribunal said in AZ. The following points of general guidance emerge from the instant case: (i) In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the parties but which a judge considering such an application for permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para 3 of the head-note in AZ, the evidence necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent from the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal (whether or not the appellant is represented at the time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided the appeal and/or the documents on file. The permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence was before the judge who decided the appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies. (ii) Permission should only be granted on the basis that the judge who decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who decided the appeal has arguably made an irrational decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, it is necessary to guard against the temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in truth no more than disagreements about the weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence. (iii) Particular care should be taken before granting permission on the ground that the judge who decided the appeal did not “sufficiently consider” or “sufficiently analyse” certain evidence or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided the appeal because the implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired by the author of the grounds or the judge considering the application for permission. Permission should usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and why this is arguably material. Decision There was no error of law in the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke. Accordingly, the decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal against the respondent decision stands.  Signed Date: 6 June 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Gill",2019-06-07
3,RP/00159/2017," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: RP/00159/2017 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS At Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated:  on 07.01 & 11.04.2019 On 03.06.2019   Before: Upper Tribunal Judge John FREEMAN and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Toby DAVEY (on 11 April) Between: Gezim [M] appellant and Secretary of State for the Home Department respondent Representation: On 7 January: for the appellant: Joanne Rothwell (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Toby Lindsay On 11 April: for the appellant: Alison Harvey (counsel instructed by Oaks) for the respondent: Mr Tony Melvin DETERMINATION AND REASONS This is an appeal, by the respondent to the original appeal, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fiona Beach), sitting at Taylor House on 28 September 2018, to allow a revocation of protection appeal by a citizen of Kosovo, born 1972. HISTORY The appellant came as a visitor in 1991, overstayed and in 1992 claimed asylum, which was granted in 1997, followed by indefinite leave to remain in 1999. He has a long-standing partner, [VD], also from Kosovo, but now a British citizen, and they have twin daughters, V1 and V2, born here on 27 May 2006. In 2002 the appellant himself applied for British citizenship, but failed to reply to Home Office inquiries, so was refused the following year. Between May and August 2014, the appellant and another man took part in a conspiracy to steal with persons unknown who were ordering electronic items over the Internet, for delivery on rounds where they were able to get the Royal Mail and Parcelforce delivery drivers to sign for the goods as if they had been delivered. Over £40,000 worth of them were stolen, and, as the sentencing judge pointed out, a substantial breach of trust was involved. This was particularly the case with the appellant, who had begun as a courier driver himself, but by this time ran a business, employing a number of others. In the judge’s view, no real distinction could be made between the defendants’ position and that of Royal Mail drivers, in terms of the absolute integrity required by their work. After a three-week trial in June 2016 the appellant and his co-defendant were found guilty, and on 6 July the appellant was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment, with slightly less for the other man. The judge noted the favourable things said about the appellant, including by a prosecution witness: he was very well-liked and hard-working, and had built up his business from virtually nothing. However, he was doing well at it, and not in want of money, except to support his growing business. His had been a leading rôle in a conspiracy involving breach of a high degree of trust, and sophisticated planning. This sentence was followed on 22 July 2016 by a notice of intention to deport, to which the appellant replied on 28 August. Next, on 5 October, came notice of the Home Office’s intention to apply the presumption set out in s. 72 (2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, allowing for his expulsion despite the grant of asylum. On 16 August 2017 the UNHCR indicated that they had no objection to this course being taken, subject to a full examination of the appellant’s individual case, and on 28 October 2017 a deportation order was signed, and sent with full reasons on the 30th. APPEAL TO DATE The appellant did not pursue any protection claim, so there is no need to discuss his conviction or its consequences any further, except to say that, despite his good conduct while in prison, and since, there is clearly a strong public interest in his removal, as Judge Beach recognized. She referred to s. 117C of the 2002 Act, and in particular to Exception 2, set out at (4). The appellant clearly had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with a ‘qualifying partner’ and both ‘qualifying children’: the question was whether the effects of his deportation would be unduly harsh on them. It is now clear that, in both her case and theirs (see RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), referred to in more detail below), at paragraph 8: “As a result of KO (Nigeria), the position is that, in determining whether Exception 2 (in section 117C(5)) applies, a court or tribunal is not to have regard to the seriousness of the offence committed by the person who is liable to deportation.” The judge found as follows: “76. it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s partner to stay here without him; but it would not be unduly harsh for her to return to Kosovo with him; 84. it would be unduly harsh for the children to stay here without him; and 87. so would it be for them to go to Kosovo with him.” Those findings were challenged by the Home Office, in rather prolix grounds (not drafted by Mr Lindsay), and permission to appeal granted by a first-tier judge, on the basis that there had been a lack of explanation as to why it would be unduly harsh for the appellant’s family to go to Kosovo with him: as just noted, this was not a finding the judge had made in respect of his partner. This did not seem to me to be what the case was really about: the children are both British citizens, who have always lived here, and already at secondary school. They are both of course entirely innocent parties, and, irrespective of what conditions might await them in Kosovo, it must now be unduly harsh to send them there. I made it clear to the parties at the first hearing on 7 January that the real question in my view had been whether the judge was entitled on the evidence to find that it would be unduly harsh either for the children or their mother to stay here without the appellant. Her decision had also been challenged on that point, as not supported by the evidence. I considered this required reconsideration, for reasons which will shortly become clear; but, in fairness to the appellant and the family as a whole, I also agreed to receive a psychological report on the mother, when re-making the decision. The further hearing for that was adjourned on 26 February, when it became clear that this report would not be ready for 4 March, as promised, till 11 April. I also made it clear that I should receive further oral evidence, limited to events since the first-tier hearing. ERROR OF LAW The appellant was sent to prison on 6 July 2016, and, with the usual 50% remission, served 13½ months before his release in late August 2017. From then till the final hearing before me, he has been at home with his family for just over 18 months. At paragraph 84, the judge concluded her reasons on the children’s position, if he were sent back to Kosovo, in this way, after accepting, on the basis of the partner’s own evidence and the report of an independent social worker, that she was ‘emotionally fragile’: “The appellant’s partner could seek support from professionals but an intervention by Social Services cannot be considered to be in the children’s best interests particularly at a time when they will be bewildered and upset by their father’s deportation from the UK.” No doubt children who had a ‘genuine and subsisting relationship’ with their father would inevitably be upset by his deportation; but it has to be said that one significant reason for these children to be especially bewildered by it must have been that their parents chose not to tell them anything about its being a possibility till just before the independent social worker made her report. Of course this mistaken, if to some extent understandable decision cannot be held against the children; but the independent social worker’s report has to be read in the light of the situation the parents had created. The grounds of appeal referred to BL (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 357. There were a number of significant factual differences, including BL having been sent to prison for four years; but I was concerned with extracting the relevant principles, rather than trying to match up the facts. The common features with this case, which led to the passage relied on by Mr Lindsay before me were these: the appellant’s partner and children were all British citizens; she was said to have difficulty in looking after them without him (in BL, because she drank more than was good for her), and the Upper Tribunal inferred that they would descend into poverty and require the support of the social services. What the Court of Appeal said about that, at paragraph 53, was this: “As against this, however, [the partner] had looked after the family while BL was in prison or immigration detention and the UT had not made any findings that the family had then descended into poverty or required the support of social services, or that if that were to happen, there would not be adequate support services for these children. The UT were entitled to work on the basis that the social services would perform their duties under the law and, contrary to the submission of [counsel for the appellant], the UT was not bound in these circumstances to regard the role of the social services as irrelevant.” While the judge reached a number of other findings on the evidence, in my judgment her conclusion on this point had to depend on her finding at paragraph 84, set out at 10 above, which showed a very different approach from that prescribed by the Court of Appeal in BL. For this reason, I took the view that her conclusion on the children’s position at 84 could not stand, and still less what she said about the effect on their mother of staying here without him at 76. This is why the judge’s decision, detailed and comprehensive as it was, had to be re-made. MORE LAW Following the fresh hearing on 11 April, our attention was drawn to RA (s.117C: ""unduly harsh""; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), and we invited submissions on it by e-mail. Following the passage already cited at 6, the Tribunal went on to reject the appellant’s argument that MK (section 55 – Tribunal options) [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) prescribed any general approach to the facts, in cases such as this. At 17, once again summarizing the effect of KO, they said this: “… the test of “unduly harsh” has a dual aspect. It is not enough for the outcome to be “severe” or “bleak”. Proper effect must be given to the adverb “unduly”. The position is, therefore, significantly far removed from the test of “reasonableness”, as found in section 117B(6)(b).” That is as far as we need go with RA, since the rest of the decision on the law is concerned with the interpretation of s. 117C (6), which was not argued in this case, where the appellant must succeed under Exception 2, or not at all (until much later: see 54 – 55). It follows from the previous citation that, having noted the facts of the appellant’s offence, and the factors in his favour as part of the background, we are no longer concerned with them, though we should be if this were a s. 117C (6) case. The effect of his deportation on his partner and children has to be considered solely in terms of whether it would be unduly harsh on them. This is a question for our judgment, to be exercised in the light of the citation just made, and no further reference to the authorities is required. FRESH HEARING: EVIDENCE We heard evidence from both the appellant and his partner [VD]: from now on we shall refer to her by her personal name only. Both also made witness statements, as did the appellant’s mother [N] and his sister [I], who live together in this country. There is a report about the children by Sally-Anne Deacon CQSM, an ‘independent social worker’ (20 September 2018, with an addendum on 27 February), and one about [V] by Dr Tracy King, a clinical psychologist (2 April). There is also a report from [V]’s GP practice, containing one entry, for 16 July 2018. Apart from school reports on the children, those are the main sources of evidence before us. The appellant Most of his first statement is concerned with his own situation: we do not say that as a criticism, but to explain why we are not going into more detail on it. He describes how [V], the children and his mother and sister all came to see him in prison three times a month, the most allowed; he also spoke to [V] and the children ‘every single day without a miss’. The appellant and [V] hadn’t discussed his real situation with the children, as they felt they were too young, but simply told them he was going away to work in an institution and would be away for a long time. He accepted with hindsight that this might have been a mistake, and in his oral evidence he also made clear that the children would have seen posters and other signs on their visits, making it obvious to them what sort of a place he was in; but that had never been mentioned. As for [V], the appellant thought she would be ‘devastated’ if he were to be deported; he had heard she had been taken to hospital with a panic attack when he went to prison, and was given intravenous medication. She had found it very hard to cope without him, ‘especially since they did not understand why I was not there for them’. She had improved since his release, but was ‘rather fragile’, and he was worried how she would cope without him, or what he was earning. In oral evidence, the appellant explained that he had had to guide [V] with a number of things on visits and calls, such as how to tax their car. She had coped; but on the basis that this was only a temporary situation. She had hated being home alone, ever since she was young (we shall return to her early life in dealing with her evidence), and, if he wasn’t there at night, would wedge chairs under their flat door for security, which the children found rather funny. The appellant said he had done his best to help the children with homework and school projects, and both he and [V] had encouraged them to value themselves as girls. Neither of them had ever smacked them, as parents tended to in Kosovo. Without his earnings, [V] wouldn’t be able to afford extras, such as tai chi (though the appellant’s sister had paid for this while he was in prison) or after-school activities or trips, and wouldn’t have the confidence to drive far (if she could still afford to run their car at all). For the present, his previous employers, who had given him a reference for his court case, and were clearly aware of his record and status, had been happy to have him back, and even promoted him. As for the family’s situation if the appellant had to go back to Kosovo, job prospects there weren’t good: 65% were presently out of work. The appellant’s work experience here had been in ‘social care and transport logistics’, neither of which existed there. If he did get a job, he gathered the average wage was €350 a month. (We may as well say right now that, while we have no doubt that an enterprising hard-working man like him could fend for himself in a country he knew, if that were our concern, we do not regard it as at all likely that he would be able to send any significant amount of money back to help his family). While the appellant’s only close relations (his mother and sister) were here, [V] had a sister, who lived in Kosovo, though she was also a Canadian citizen. That had meant they could visit each other, and they had done so probably about ten times over the 15 years the appellant and [V] had been together. On four or five of those occasions, [V] had taken the children to Kosovo. Usually they spent five or six weeks away, as [V] got the same long summer holidays as them: the appellant would join them for two or three, as and when he could get away from work. Often they would go on trips (more cheaply arranged from Kosovo) to the coast in Albania, or even to Turkey. They had last all been to Kosovo in 2014, and since he had been unable to travel, [V]’s sister had been to see them here. [V] [V]’s first statement gives considerable detail about her family history. She was born in Kosovo in 1973, and when she was only nine months old, her father murdered her mother: she was lying on the bed next to her at the time, and was told what happened later by her maternal grandmother. Her father suffered from schizophrenia, and spent the rest of his life in hospitals, till he died in about 2009. All the children were first taken in by their paternal grandparents; but later the grandparents found that too much for them, and [V]’s siblings were sent to live with other relations. [V]’s brother went to Spain when he was 18, and she has been in touch with him only once or twice a year, in brief phone calls, since she last saw him in about 2012. One sister (Sofie) qualified in medicine before the war, and went to live with her husband in Canada, where they are citizens; but, as Sofie’s qualifications were not recognized there, they went back to Kosovo later: he runs a successful business, while she practises medicine. [V]’s other sister ([B]) came with her to this country in 1998, and married a Spaniard. Unfortunately, after [V] met the appellant in 2005, relations between her and [B] broke down, and they haven’t been in touch at all for the last three years, even though they live quite nearby. This has also affected [V]’s relationship with Sofie, though she does not explain to what extent. [V] says the appellant was always a hands-on father, and would feed, bathe and put their daughters to bed when they were small. Since then he has taken them for all kinds of activities, and shared fully in the house-work. She says his love has made her very secure and confident, and would be devastated if she lost his company, though she would never lose his love. The appellant’s arrest had come as a complete surprise to [V], while she was on holiday in Kosovo: he had been with her and the children, but had returned the week before they were due to come back. She found the investigation and trial process so intensely stressful that she couldn’t even write down the contact details for him when he was sentenced, and his solicitor had to do it for her. The following morning she was having panic attacks, with breathing problems: she got a friend to take the children to school, and went to a hospital A&E department, where tablets failed to calm her down, so she was given an intravenous injection, which enabled her to come home that night, with the help of the appellant’s sister [I] (Lili). Afterwards [V] managed to cope, by reminding herself that the appellant would only be in prison for just over a year. They went to see him regularly, and found him very emotional; the girls were not told he was in prison, but clearly suspected it. After they were told, in advance of their visit to Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’), they broke down, and were crying all through their interview with her. Since then they have been less anxious, as for the moment their father is with them. [V] speaks highly of the appellant’s attitude to others, polite to everyone, and generous, particularly to drivers who worked for him. She was shocked and surprised by what he had done, but regarded it as very much out of character. [V] says the appellant’s mother [N] is old (now 74) and has too many health problems of her own to help anyone else. His sister Lili works long hours, and has decided to remain single: she is very fond of the children, but hasn’t got very much time to help with them; nor does she drive. The appellant’s English is much better than [V]’s, so he has always been the one to help with homework, and go to parents’ evenings. [We found the appellant’s English extremely good, and [V]’s more than good enough to give evidence in; as should be the case for both of them, given the length of time they have been in this country]. [V] says she is happy to take the children to Kosovo for holidays, but not for them to grow up there, for reasons she gives, and which we have already accepted. She says she is finding it increasingly hard to cope as the hearing date (for his first-tier appeal) draws near, and is taking prescribed medication. The appellant was dishonest, but didn’t think about the consequences to his family, or anyone else, at the time; but seeing them suffer has been so distressing for him that he would never offend again. [V]’s second statement (6 February 2019) covers a good deal of the same ground again. She is finding it hard to sleep, or to listen to her daughters when they want to tell her about their day at school. She doesn’t feel she is doing her best at work, though no-one at her school has complained. She does have the children skills which might be expected from a teaching assistant; but coping with her own daughters’ needs, in her present mental state, is another matter. In her oral evidence, [V] said she hadn’t been taking medication again after her visit to the A&E till last summer, when the first-tier hearing was coming up. She knew the appellant had received a notice of intention to deport in July 2016; but she had been coping from month to month while he was in prison. As for visits to Kosovo, the appellant had last come with them before his arrest in 2014: he used to come for part of their visit every year. In 2018 [V] and the children had been there for four or five weeks and stayed with her sister Sofie: her sister-in-law Lili had paid their fares, and the appellant, though he couldn’t travel, had encouraged them to go, as had her GP. Lili and her mother lived not far away, in Gospel Oak, but, as previously mentioned, were unable to give much help. The children were still going to their tai chi, and had started piano lessons just before the last New Year. They all saw Lili and her mother on a Sunday; but she didn’t feel up to having the children’s friends to stay over. [V] provided evidence of recent appointments with Komal Oza, a ‘psychological wellbeing practitioner’, with iCope, an NHS service to which she had been referred by her GP in February. Mr Oza says they had met once, and have five further sessions planned: [V] was suffering from low mood and anxiety, and he hoped to be able to give her some help and support; but he thought it likely that, owing to the lack of certainty around her and her family’s future, she would continue to experience these symptoms. [N] (the appellant’s mother) [N] sets out the family history in Kosovo, and how they came to make their way to this country in 1994. She is still suffering from her husband’s death in 2010, after 44 years of marriage. Now she is nearly 75, with ‘very high blood pressure’, dizziness and shoulder and knee pain. [I] lives with her, and looks after her, subject to work pressure. She was so upset during the appellant’s trial that her family had to send her to Kosovo for the duration, where she suffered from continuous chest pain. She says how dependent she is on the appellant’s help; but we cannot consider whether the effect of his deportation on her would be unduly harsh, so this is more relevant to the question of what help she, or [I] could give [V] with the children and things in general, if he had to leave. Of course she speaks highly of him, and of the children, and expresses the fear that “… the whole family will descend into some darkness”, if he had to go. [I] (the appellant’s sister) [I] has been a British citizen since 2002: she gives more of the family history, and her own, including her work record, and the breakdown of her marriage in this country. She received her psychotherapy diploma in 2008, and has since done voluntary counselling work for six years for one day a week. She works for a beauty products company. [I] does not give her age, but was clearly a young grown-up when she first came here as an au pair in 1987 – 89. She had been very shocked when she found out about the appellant’s crimes; but she says he is still visibly sorry for them. Besides other visits, he always comes round to see her and their mother on a Sunday, which is their special family day, when they took care to book prison visits. On the question of what happened while the appellant was in prison, [I] says this (paragraph 23 of her statement) I managed to somehow support my brother’s family while [he] was in prison, but it was with the understanding that it was going to be only for the duration of his sentence. I also experienced my fair share of emotional turmoil trying to put on a brave face while at work and with my family. It was extremely difficult because I was constantly delaying my duties … sometimes calling in sick just so I can stay at home to recover my energy or even just simply by crying to myself on my own. [I] goes on to say that, much as she loves the children, she would never be able fully to support them, emotionally or financially, as she doesn’t earn enough, and sometimes has to travel for her work. She is afraid the responsibility in itself of taking her brother’s place would be too much for her. [I] explains the effect of what happened on her and her mother: As a result of [V]’s condition my mother and I rallied round and helped every day the best way we could. It was not easy, because all of us carried our own share of distress. We were in a constant state of just surviving every day the best way we could. They hadn’t known how to explain to the girls, then only ten, that their father faced deportation. Dr King (the clinical psychologist) Dr King’s very recent, long, discursive and somewhat repetitive report on [V] was of course not before the judge. She gives her assessment of her as suffering from the following personality disorders: Dependent Personality Disorder (over-reliance on others to meet emotional and physical needs, hard to make decisions without excessive advice from others, passivity, fear of being left alone to care for self, devastated by separation and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship). Avoidant Personality Style (extreme inhibition, inadequacy and sensitivity to negative criticism and loss and may go to great lengths to stay in the relationship), and Schizoid Personality Style (solitary habits, emotional distance difficulties expressing emotion) Dr King’s answers to the questions about [V] she was asked by the appellant’s solicitors were as follows (mostly summarized by us): Is she suffering from any known psychological conditions that have affected her mental health due to past experiences? See above, also Major Depression (recurrent, severe) and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Unusually dependent, self-effacing and non-competitive; lack of initiative and general avoidance of autonomy; vulnerable without support and sensitive to criticism; intensely needy of affection and nurturing; destabilized by finding out at the crucial age of 10 how she had come to lose both parents, with unconscious memories of the event itself ‘stored physiologically in the body’, reducing her mental resilience; exposed to the war in Kosovo, ‘females being particularly at risk’; high anxiety level apparently ‘suppressed to some degree with a functional level of depressive symptomatology to reduce the connection with the emotion of fear; any loss likely to trigger her unprocessed trauma and her early isolated life as a child; may withdraw from relationships if she fears rejection; lost older relations earlier than usual. Will try to appear calm, despite underlying fear; submits to the needs and fears of others to avoid rejection; “simple responsibilities may then demand more energy than she can muster; may feel life as empty, but draining, with weariness and apathy; may withdraw, depriving herself of support; fearful of humiliation and exclusion; shy, apprehensive and awkward; sees herself as “weak, fragile and inadequate and believes she is unable to meet everyday tasks without help”, minimal self-confidence, and puts herself down in the hope of reassurance. Disorientation and despondency indicate major depressive disorder; sensitive to ridicule and ‘worries that she worries’, giving the appearance of generalized personality disorder; daily apprehensive and short of sleep, tired, with aches and pains; restless, unable to concentrate, easily distracted and apt to fear the worst. If so, are these long-term and do they require sustained long-term treatment? Long-term treatment for at least two years required; at risk of frequent mental health instability till stabilized; even then at risk of relapses, owing to her age and the state to which her mental health has got. Medication likely to help, but anti-depressants will only manage some symptoms; needs personal therapy to build up her self-confidence and reduce her anxiety and low mood. Needs different approaches, such as Schema Focused Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing, less likely to be available on the NHS, and likely to cost about £100 a session for two years; current counselling will support her during that time, but will not deal with her underlying problems. Are these conditions likely to affect her day-to-day functioning and activities, such as ability to continue employment, study and running of the household and most importantly care of her daughters who are about to enter their teenage years and puberty? She will have difficulties in empathizing with and in setting in context her daughters’ concerns at their crucial age; at the moment her employer can cope with her having ‘bad days’; but this may not last, especially as she is working with special needs children, so she might lose her job; in view of her father’s reported schizophrenia, she might be at risk of genetic mental health trouble over time. She has a good relationship with the appellant’s mother and sister; but [N] needs support herself, and [I] can’t help with long-term support. This might mean her mental health got worse fast, and expose the children to neglect and isolation, for which she would be unlikely to seek help. In your opinion, how would the deportation of her husband exacerbate the psychological difficulties that she is experiencing today? Her dependent nature, there since her childhood experiences, is focused on the appellant, and would last for at least two years, at a crucial age for the children, when they would effectively lose both parents, one to deportation, and the other to mental health troubles. Deportation would be worse than when he went to prison, as it would be indefinite. She couldn’t see or speak to him so often, owing to the cost and safety concerns for women (and particularly the girls) in Kosovo. “Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident” [It is not clear how Dr King is able to give a professional opinion about this, on the basis of her very recent knowledge of [V]]. Explain or comment on her current difficulties that she is experiencing since her partner’s appeal was won, and then when the Home Office appealed, and the whole situation regarding the deportation has returned to square one. The situation for [V] is very difficult, as she was confident it had been put right, but then returned to the original very frightening situation. “This feeds into her sense of instability and lack of control and reinforces her sense of helplessness. These will create physiological responses in the body that are likely to directly trigger her early infant trauma of being present at her mother’s murder and her teenage trauma of being exposed to war in Kosovo. The deterioration evident is explained in prior questions with regard to her overall psychological formulation” Ms Deacon (the ‘independent social worker’ naturally covers a great deal within Dr King’s expertise, and also covered by her; so we shall try to summarize her reports only so far as they add anything significant. They do not contain any summary of her conclusions, and reference to them is not helped by the lack of numbered paragraphs. We have already dismissed the possibility of the girls’ having to move to Kosovo, so that part of Ms Deacon’s evidence need not be considered. Clearly if they are to stay here without the appellant, then they must have their mother to look after them; so the question for us is whether it would be unduly harsh for them or her to have to stay here without him. While it is clear from Ms Deacon’s report that the appellant is a very good father, very close to the girls, and a provider, it is equally clear that [V] has “highly skilled levels of parenting”, as Ms Deacon puts it. Both girls are doing very well at school (as their reports show; and both were described as ‘exceptionally gifted’ to Ms Deacon by the head of their year) and equally well in their personal lives, as Ms Deacon’s report makes clear at p 17. So far as the direct effect on the girls of being without their father is concerned, Ms Deacon says this in her first report, at p 16 It is also argued that the girls could maintain contact with their father through regular visits to Kosovo and modern means of communication. However I feel that these methods are significantly inadequate and impracticable given [their] familiarity with their father’s physical presence, the positive nature of their attachment and the family’s anticipated lack of financial resources Ms Deacon had already given the basis for this conclusion, so far as the girls’ attachment to the appellant was concerned, and on that basis it can easily be accepted that keeping in touch at a distance, and on visits, would be very much less satisfactory for both them and him. At p 7, Ms Deacon quotes [I], who (she says) is a qualified child and adolescent psychotherapist, as saying that the appellant’s time in prison was … devastating for the children, but manageable with everyone’s support because it was short term and the girls were able to see their dad regularly. If this happens again it will be forever and the levels of abandonment that the girls would feel would have a significant effect on the future for them in terms of their identity, their mental health and their ability to fulfil their potential. We do not of course take this by way of professional expertise on the part of [I], talking about close members of her own family. Given the effect of KO, as set out in RA (see our 15), we take the view that the main question for us is not whether [V] could keep up the present standards of care for the girls on her own, without the appellant’s emotional, practical and financial support; but whether her ability to do so, without him, would collapse to the point of its being unduly harsh to her, or, even more importantly, them, for him to be removed. The answer mainly depends on Dr King’s evidence; but we shall look at Ms Deacon’s to see what help she can give on it. Ms Deacon gives her opinion (at p 16), disclaiming any specific professional expertise in this area, that the appellant’s deportation would appear likely to result in “a protracted, if not permanent decline in [V]’s mental health, which is likely to compromise her current highly skilled levels of parenting”. The evidence Ms Deacon relates in her first report, which is capable of supporting that conclusion, is already available to us from other witnesses: for example, at p 9, the appellant’s about her jamming their flat door with chairs if he is not there, and [I]’s about her lacking resilience and having ‘fallen apart’ while the appellant was in prison, and needing to be hospitalized. As we know from her own evidence (see 28), this did not last long. In Ms Deacon’s second report, she deals with the case under three headings, which do not entirely reflect the contents of what follows. Her first point (1) consists in a return to what happened when the appellant went to prison; then she goes on to consider the effect on the girls themselves of having to do without their father. In considering the ‘extreme and understandable distress’ they had shown, we shall need to consider, as she does not, the effect of the way the news of its possibility had been broken to them: see 29. That is the context for our consideration of what she goes on to say about them experiencing their father’s permanent absence “as tantamount to a parental death”. At 2, Ms Deacon again draws the distinction between the effect on [V] of the appellant’s permanent absence, as compared to his temporary absence in prison, and returns to the quality of contact that could be kept up between him, her and the children, for example by Skype, from Kosovo. She expresses the view that [V]’s ‘anticipated heightened levels of anxiety’ would force her to terminate her employment, in which case regular visits there would be beyond her means. At 3, Ms Deacon makes the point that teenagers do better with the support of their parents, and may take to drink, drugs or other vices if allowed to go astray. She notes these girls’ high performance at school, and ambitions for their future lives, and repeats the view that the appellant’s absence in itself would have “… potential to have catastrophic implications for the girls’ futures”, especially if [V] became ‘unwell’ without him. At 4, Ms Deacon notes the availability of social care; but she takes the view that this would be unlikely to be offered on a long-term basis as a protection need for the children, as they have an extended family who could take responsibility. This is slightly at odds with [V]’s own evidence about [I]’s commitments and [N]’s lack of capacity. Ms Deacon goes on to note the availability of voluntary support; but she concludes that this would be unlikely to be offered more than once a week, which would not be adequate. She has not informed herself on [V]’s take-up of mental health support; but again she speaks of “a significant delay in assessing this resource”, owing to nationwide demands. GP report This relates to what is described as a first depressive episode, which [V] came in with on 16 July 2018. By this time the appellant would have been out of prison for nearly a year, and was awaiting his first-tier appeal hearing on 28 September. Her history is given as ‘’depression with low mood, lack concentration, difficulty focusing, poor sleep’’: the context is given, and the only further potentially significant point is ‘’prev[ious] depression around time girls born, again, never self harm thoughts then either. Case due to be heard in September’’. [V] was prescribed the well-known anti-depressant Citalopram, and was to be reviewed in two or three weeks. It was noted “can self ref[er] psychology at any stage”: no doubt this was advice which had been given her at the time. There is then a final entry ‘crisis plans’: presumably this also referred to advice, but no further details are given. There is no evidence from the GP about any further appointments, or prescriptions; and no evidence of any reference by [V] or anyone else to a psychologist, until this was finally done in response to the application made by the appellant’s then counsel, on the basis of which I adjourned the hearing to 4 March, and then 11 April. (I was a little put out to see that Dr King dates her instructions only from 9 March; but Miss Harvey succeeded in reassuring me that something at least had been done before that). That concludes our treatment of the main sources of evidence, as listed at 17, so we shall now turn to the argument. DISCUSSION Both advocates made oral submissions at the hearing, and others in writing, in Miss Harvey’s case by e-mail, in response to the late submission of RA by Mr Melvin. Since these dealt with her general argument, it is convenient to take that first. Besides the ‘unduly harsh’ point, extensively discussed at the hearing, Miss Harvey relies on the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception under s. 117C (6), on the basis that the appellant … has lived lawfully in the UK for some 28 years, since 1 September 1992 and was recognised as a refugee from the war in Kosovo. The very long length of his residence and that, as a refugee, for many years the UK was the only country that he could call home are factors, taken cumulatively with those that bring the case within Exception 2, constitute very compelling circumstances. That is not an argument we can accept: if we had regarded it as arguable, then we should either have had to re-open the case for a third hearing, or else invite Mr Melvin to reply by e-mail. However, while the ‘very compelling circumstances’ exception is open in a medium-sentence case, as made clear in NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662, this case was argued throughout before us, with good reason, on the basis that this appellant must succeed, if at all, under Exception 2. The version of the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument put forward in Miss Harvey’s e-mail here is ‘over and above’ Exception 1, if anything. Exception 1 was not argued before us, or at the first-tier hearing, for the good reason that this appellant, born on 28 December 1972, was already 28 years 8 months old when he arrived in this country, on 31 August 1991, and, following that, had spent only another 26 years and (nearly) 2 months here by the date of the decision under appeal on 30 October 2017, so had not been here for ‘most of his life’. The ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which will only become relevant if the appellant fails on the ‘unduly harsh’ point: see NA (Pakistan) at paragraph 36. Besides that, it is quite clear from the appellant’s own evidence that he has quite happily taken his family on holiday to Kosovo and nearby countries a number of times over more recent years, and is by no means a person whose only possible home is here now. Dealing with the present situation as we must, the ‘very compelling circumstances’ argument is one which could not in any case succeed on its merits. The other additional point of law taken in Miss Harvey’s e-mail is her reliance, in rather general terms, on the continuing validity of Strasburg jurisprudence on article 8. While no doubt she is right in principle on that, we were not in any case proposing to take any notice of the Home Office circular relied on by Mr Melvin, but to base our decision squarely on the ‘unduly harsh’ point, as laid down by Parliament, definitively defined in KO, explained in RA and argued before us. As already explained at 16, there is no need to go further into the authorities in this case: there is one question, for us to answer in what is described in MK as an exercise of ‘evaluative judgment’. Would the consequences of the appellant’s removal be unduly harsh, either for his children (directly or because of the effect on their mother), on on [V]? Dealing first with the direct consequences, we entirely accept that both the girls and [V] are particularly close to the appellant; in [V]’s case, perhaps all the more because of the continuing effects of her grisly early history (see 25); remote contact with him (by Skype or the like) could not replace face-to-face, especially for girls of that age; and they would all have a considerably lower standard of living without his income; the only direct relevance of this to the ‘unduly harsh’ criterion is that it would make it harder for them to go and see him in Kosovo. We do not accept that such visits would be completely impossible: [I] could no doubt give some help in finding the money for occasional tickets for the cheap flights which are on offer to Kosovo, as with many eastern European destinations, even if she is unable to take on any regular or continuing responsibility. Once there, [V]’s sister Sofie certainly could, and there is reason to suppose, given her past hospitality, would help with arrangements. The result is that, though the direct effects of the appellant’s removal on the girls remain something to be borne in mind on the ‘unduly harsh’ question as a whole, they cannot answer it in his favour on their own. The same would apply to the direct effects on [V], if they went no further than missing his practical, financial or emotional support. Sadly, as made clear in KO and a number of previous decisions, missing a father or a partner, even very much indeed, may be harsh, but is a normal, rather than an unduly harsh consequence of his deportation. In our view the key to this case is whether the consequences of the appellant’s deportation would go so far as to include what in ordinary language we should call a complete breakdown on [V]’s part. If they did, we should be prepared to accept that they would indeed be unduly harsh for her, and, because of their effect on her, for the girls; but not otherwise. Simply not being able to look after them as well as she does now would not be enough to make it unduly harsh for them. While that state of affairs would no doubt be extremely worrying for [V], we do not think that could be described as unduly harsh for her, unless, once again, it led to a complete breakdown. CONCLUSIONS As we have already made clear, the crucial evidence on this point is Dr King’s: from her 4.1, she had exactly the same sources of information as we do, with a three-hour interview with [V] taking the place of the oral evidence we heard from her. While we do not doubt the general validity of Dr King’s conclusions at 1 and 2 (see our 41), the most relevant questions for our purposes are 3 and 4. Bearing in mind that Dr King’s first-hand knowledge of [V] is so very recent (from their interview less than a month before the hearing), some detailed consideration of her recent history was clearly important. Dr King lists the GP report among her sources, and we should have expected some discussion at 3 of whether or not there had been any further visits to the surgery, or attempts to seek their help, or that of the NHS psychology service; and, if not, why not. We do not doubt that [V] was genuinely anxious about the appellant’s future when she saw the GP last July. It was clearly significant that she did so, and on the evidence before us only did so, when the first-tier hearing was approaching. The question is whether [V] went to see her GP because the uncertainty involved in that prospect had made her notably more anxious than she had been before; or because she wanted, or had been told, to get further evidence for the hearing? Similarly there was no attempt to get any further psychological help for [V] till after the Home Office appeal first came before me on 7 January, and Dr King’s involvement was forensic, rather than therapeutic. Only in February (see 35) did [V] get referred by her GP to Mr Oza, and any help he had been able to give her was at a very early stage, though he was not optimistic about the results. We have no evidence as to how the referral to Mr Oza came about, though the involvement of Dr King was clearly on legal advice, following the adjournment in January. We do bear in mind what both Dr King and Ms Deacon say about [V]’s reluctance to seek help, and we certainly do not regard the fact that she only did so on the occasions just mentioned as fatal to the contention that she would break down without the appellant, failing the two years or more of weekly treatment recommended by Dr King under 2. We regard her as an entirely genuine witness, and we have no doubt that her visit to her GP when the first-tier hearing was approaching was brought about by genuinely increased anxiety on her part. What the lack of any other previous attempts to seek help does mean, however, is that [V]’s likely response to being without the appellant has to be tested, so far as practical, rather than theoretical facts are concerned, to a very large extent on what happened while he was in prison between 1 July 2016 and late August 2017. Under 4, Dr King says this about [V] being without the appellant then Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in her presentation was evident. However she could see him weekly and have daily telephone contact with him for support. There was also an end in sight for them to reunite. She therefore will not have felt so helpless or out of control as she does now. The last three sentences of that passage make perfectly good sense, and indeed correspond with findings we should have been prepared to make for ourselves on the evidence before us, including [V]’s live evidence, and rather anxious appearance as she gave it. However the language of the first (‘presentation’) tends to suggest a professional observation by the user, which of course was something Dr King had had no opportunity of while the appellant was in prison. There is a similar lack of investigation of [V]’s recent history (see 52) on the part of Ms Deacon, so far as she is qualified to give an opinion on the point we are considering; and she refers to her ‘hospitalisation’ at 48 without making it clear that it had only been temporary. Of course we bear in mind that the intravenous medication [V] was given when she took herself in to the A&E department had been a rather drastic intervention, and, in view of her failure to respond to the tablets she was given, no doubt a necessary one. However, [V] had been able to cope after that, though again we bear in mind that she was able to speak to the appellant every day, and see him every week. In the process she had to be talked through such ordinary details of organizing one’s own life as how to set about taxing the family car, to which she has now been introduced. Although the appellant refers to the anxiety (irrational in this country) which [V] had shown by jamming the front door with chairs every night when he was away, this now dates back nearly two years. More recently, she had felt able to leave the appellant at home here last summer and take the children to Kosovo for four or five weeks, though with the help of [I], who had paid for their trip, and they stayed with [V]’s sister Sofie. It is quite true that the girls, both 13, are now at a crucial stage in their lives, and that remains a relevant factor, though it does not in itself require their father’s appeal to be allowed (as made clear by the Tribunal in RA, in their treatment of MK). The other self-evident truth about them is that they will be growing up fast: as time goes on, they will need less support from their mother, and be able to give her more themselves. On that basis, the crucial period for the girls will last for a relatively short time after the appellant has to leave, if eventually that does happen. While [N] is unlikely, in view of her health, to be able to give any practical support, a grandmother’s wisdom and experience can itself be valuable. Though [I] disclaims any ability to commit herself to long-term support, she has, to her credit, shown herself ready and willing to make a valuable contribution by paying for [V]’s trip to Kosovo with the girls last summer. Neither Dr King nor Ms Deacon deals with this point: 13-year olds, and particularly girls are growing up fast, and the need for support for them and their mother cannot be assessed as if the situation were static. We bear in mind what Dr King says under 2 (see our 41) about [V]’s need for long-term help, and the limited value of what can be done in the short term; and also Ms Deacon’s views at 52 about the limited scope of help available from public sources. However, on the basis that the crucial period for the girls is likely to last for a limited time, [V] and the girls can all get useful help from [I], and [V] should be able to cope with such short-term help as she can get from her GP, social services, or the NHS psychology service (as she did without any of that, though with much greater opportunity for contact with the appellant, while he was in prison). That does not entirely deal with [V]’s own position, as she would no doubt still miss the appellant very badly, even after the girls had adapted to his departure. However, once she had got through the crucial period for them, we think she should be able to stay here with them for as long as they need her to look after them: while that may be for more than five years, it is likely to be less than the ten for which the appellant himself would be excluded, following deportation. We think the judge was right not to regard joining the appellant in Kosovo as unduly harsh for [V], for her own sake rather than the girls’. Once they no longer needed her living with them and looking after them, [V] would have the choice whether to wait till the appellant could eventually rejoin her here (which we see no reason why he should not, once ten years have passed); or to rejoin him in Kosovo. That would give [V] at least something other than permanent separation from the appellant to look forward to, and so we cannot regard the consequences of his removal as unduly harsh for her, for her own sake, either. On that basis, though the consequences of the appellant’s having to go will certainly be harsh for the whole family, we cannot, on the law as declared in KO, regard them as unduly harsh, either for [V] or for the girls. That is the starting-point for our consideration of article 8, and we have not been referred to any specific Strasburg or other jurisprudence or legislation which might make it inapplicable, or modify it in this case. The result is that the Home Office appeal must be allowed. We reach this conclusion with complete lack of enthusiasm: [V] and the girls are all British citizens, leading hard-working lives and, in the girls’ cases, potentially valuable ones to society outside their own family. They are all innocent parties, and the consequences for all of them will be harsh. RA makes it clear that the appellant is not entitled to rely on the result of the individual case in MK, as opposed to the principles set out in it, endorsed in KO; but we do note that the children in MK were only seven, so would go on requiring support for very much longer than in this case. Even the appellant, not that his interests are for us to consider, has always been a hard-working man, and, apart from becoming involved in crime, an excellent father and partner. He was an engaging witness, and we have no doubt he genuinely regrets his past dishonesty, if only for the harsh effects it has had, and may now go on having for his family. If we had had to consider only the proportionality of his removal to the public interest in the prevention of crime, without looking at it through the ‘unduly harsh’ test, then we might have reached a different result; but that is not the case.

Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant(s).1. This is a decision to which both judges have contributed.2. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart promulgated 22.11.18, dismissing on asylum and humanitarian protection grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of 6.2.17 to terminate his refugee status and to deport him from the UK, but allowing the appeal on articles 3 & 8 ECHR grounds. For ease of reference I will refer to the Secretary of State (who was the original respondent) as ""the Secretary of State"" and to FA (who the original respondent) as the ""claimant.""3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson granted permission to appeal to the Secretary of State on 12.12.18. 4. The claimant cross appealed against the dismissal of the appeal on refugee grounds but permission was refused in the First-tier Tribunal by Designated First-Tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft on 7.1.19 and in the Upper Tribunal by Upper Tribunal Judge Smith on 8.3.19.5. It follows that the only valid appeal before the Upper Tribunal is that of the Secretary of State against the decision allowing the appeal on articles 3 and 8 grounds. However, the claimant has served a Rule 24 reply, which we have carefully considered.6. Whilst the claimant was legally represented at the appeal hearing, he chose not to attend.7. At the conclusion of the oral submissions before us, both parties sought and were granted permission to lodge and serve within 14 days further legal case authorities touching on the issue as to whether it is open to a tribunal to find that a potential deportee would be at risk on return of treatment infringing article 3 rights because of a claimed reasonable likelihood that he would go on to commit criminal offences, thereby resulting in his punishment and incarceration in a country of return where the treatment of detained persons has been held to be inhuman and infringing article 3 ECHR. The claimant also sought and was granted permission to cite further legal case authority relevant to the issue of delay raised by the Home Office in argument at the hearing but not foreshadowed in its submitted grounds. 8. The claimant's further submissions, dated 13.5.19, were received by the tribunal on 14.5.19. The appellant's further submissions, dated 14.5.19, were received by the tribunal on 14.5.19. The claimant then made yet further submissions, dated 15.5.19, we have carefully considered the respective submissions. Error of Law9. In an otherwise careful and detailed consideration of the relevant issues by the First-tier Tribunal, for the reasons set out below we have found such error of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require it to be set aside and remade by remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal on the articles 3 and 8 ECHR issue only. 10. We remind ourselves that the issue is not whether we or another judge would have made the same decision as the First-tier Tribunal but whether the decision made in relation to Articles 3 and 8 is sustainable. 11. Having heard detailed submissions from both Mr Lindsay for the Secretary of State as appellant and Mr Sellwood for the claimant we find as follows. Late Issue12. Mr Lindsay relied on the details grounds of application for permission to appeal, which he accepted may not have been as clear as they could have been. He also sought to rely and to make submissions on an additional issue not addressed in the grounds but which appears to have been relied on by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at [144] of the decision, namely the apparent delay between the index offence committed in 2009 and the deportation decision of 6.2.18. At [36] the judge recorded the submission on behalf of the Secretary of State that there was no evidence to suggest that either the public interest had lessened or that the claimant's private and family life had strengthened during the intervening period. Mr Lindsay argued that that submission had not been addressed by the judge and thus there was an error of law in the reliance on delay made at [144] of the decision.13. Mr Sellwood objected to the late introduction of the delay issue when it had not featured in the details grounds of application for permission to appeal. Whilst he accepted that he would be able to address the issue in his oral submissions, he made the fair point that he had not been able to prepare a detailed response, or to research any relevant authorities on the point. After hearing both parties on the matter, we considered that in a detailed consideration as to whether a person was to be deported to the DRC, with potentially serious implications, we should enable all relevant issues to be addressed rather than enforce a strict procedural adherence to the pleaded grounds but would ensure that the claimant was not unfairly prejudiced by the late introduction of the issue. For that reason, as indicated above, at the end of the hearing we granted Mr Sellwood the opportunity to identify to the tribunal panel any relevant authorities before the making of the decision on the appeal.Delay14. Mr Lindsay raised the new ground of the judge's reliance at [144] on delay as a material consideration in reducing the weight to be given to the public interest in deportation and in allowing the appeal. The judge noted that 9 years had elapsed since the commission of the index offence justifying deportation and that consideration of revocation of refugee status began in 2012. The judge continued, ""At that point no action was taken against him. It must be inferred that having conducted a review at the time the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest necessitated the appellant's deportation."" 15. We accept the submission that the judge was in error of law to draw such an inference, particularly given the wide ranging changes to the relevant provisions governing deportation considerations that have taken place since 2012. To reduce the weight of the public interest in this way because of the delay and the drawing of such an inference is an error of law, particularly as the public interest has not diminished over time and it cannot properly be inferred that at the time the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest to necessitate the claimant's deportation.16. In granting leave to make further submissions on the issue, we accepted that Mr Sellwood had not prepared the claimant's case to address this new issue. However, we find nothing in the further submissions strengthens his argument or undermines the complaint of the Secretary of State that reliance on delay was not justified. Reliance is made on RLP (Bah revisited - expeditious justice) Jamaica [2017] UKUT 00330 (IAC), where it was held that in cases where the public interest favouring deportation is potent and pressing, even egregious and unjustified delay on the part of the Secretary of State in making the underlying decision is unlikely to tip the balance in the individual's favour in the article 8 proportionality balancing exercise. However, we accept that delay is a potentially relevant factor in the proportionality exercise. In EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41, the House of Lords held that delay may reduce the weight otherwise to be accorded to firm and fair immigration control if the delay is a result of a dysfunctional system which creates unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes. We also accept that, obviously, during a period of delay an applicant may develop closer personal and social ties, thereby strengthening a family and private life claim to remain in the UK. In MN-T (Colombia) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 893, the Court of Appeal held that delay may lessen the weight of public interest considerations of deterrence and societal revulsion. Further, during lengthy delay a foreign criminal may be able to demonstrate he has rehabilitated. These are all relevant considerations but the difficulty for Mr Sellwood's argument is that these were not adequately addressed in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, where the judge proceeds on the assumption that it must be inferred from the delay that the Secretary of State did not consider the public interest necessitated deportation. That assessment was flawed and unsustainable. It follows that on this additional ground of reliance on delay, we also find the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in error of law. Article 317. Following a lengthy and careful digest of the evidence and the findings and conclusions which are not at issue in this appeal, the article 3 considerations are set out relatively briefly between [126] and [128] of the decision. In essence, the tribunal found that whilst there would be no Article 15(c) risk on return and no reason to depart from the Country Guidance of BM and others (returnees - criminal and noncriminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC), which is to the effect that those who have been convicted of offences in the UK are not at real risk of being persecuted or suffering serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR on return to the DRC, the judge concluded that there was a risk of destitution infringing Article 3 for the following specified reasons set out at [128] of the decision:(a) In light of the appellant's age when he left the DRC;(b) The likelihood of there being no family support available to him on return;(c) His lack of fluency in the main languages; and(d) Obstacles in securing accommodation and employment, although his partner confirmed that she would be willing to financially assist him in the short but not the longer term.18. In his oral submissions, Mr Lindsay relied primarily on two decisions from the Court of Appeal, copies of which were provided to the panel:(a) Binbuga [2019] EWCA Civ 551;(b) Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442.19. Mr Lindsay's attack on the destitution reasons can be summarised briefly as follows:(a) The age when the claimant left the DRC is not determinative of the issue of destitution;(b) The absence of family support was contradicted by the finding that the claimant's partner would assist him in the short term;(c) As is clear from [76] the claimant spoke Lingala with his mother, save for certain words he cannot understand. He would therefore be able to communicate in the DRC and would have little difficulty gaining fluency;(d) Difficulties in securing accommodation and/or employment did not amount to evidence of destitution.20. Whilst we are satisfied that the judge did not make any mistake of fact or reach inconsistent findings in respect of these issues, we have carefully considered whether any of these (or other) factors individually or taken together could justify a conclusion of a real risk of destitution sufficient to infringe Article 3 ECHR bearing in mind the high threshold required. In Said, the Court of Appeal held that to succeed in resisting removal on Article 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or deprivation on return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country or others, the person liable to deportation must show circumstances which bring him within the approach of the Strasbourg Court in the D and N cases. 21. Mr Sellwood sought to draw a distinction relying on [29] to [30] of Said, and submitted that the risk of destitution arises because of the state's indifference to circumstances which would amount to an infringement of Article 3, effectively an acquiescence in harm, and thus submitted that the N threshold did not apply. However, we did not find any such distinction was made by the First-tier Tribunal or applies on the facts of this case. It is clear that the judge's reasoning for finding a risk of destitution did not rely on indiscriminate violence in IDP camps or because of the conditions of the country, or similar such considerations, but specifically because of the claimant's personal circumstances on return. 22. We find that the judge did not consider the very high threshold applicable and did not have regard to Said. Further, it is clear to us that even taking the evidence at its highest, the circumstances on return cannot justify such a conclusion even in the challenging environment that would face anyone returning to the DRC. In particular, as has already been noted, the appellant has a good understanding of the language and the judge found that he will have some temporary financial assistance from his partner on return. In the circumstances we are driven to conclude this part of the decision is flawed for inadequate reasoning, insufficient to justify the conclusion of an infringement of Article 3 on the basis of a risk of destitution and, therefore, in error of law. 23. Mr Sellwood and the Rule 24 response points out that the prospect of destitution was not the only basis upon which the judge concluded Article 3 would be infringed. We agree. As part and parcel of the Article 3 conclusion, at [128] the judge also found a ""risk of (the claimant) returning to drug use and reasonable risk of further incarceration in DRC."" We also find this conclusion problematic even though it is based on the unchallenged expert evidence, in part of Dr Kofi but to a greater extent of Dr Lackenby, summarised at [127] of the decision. Dr Lackenby considered that the appellant would be vulnerable to return to drug use, antisocial behaviour and/or criminal activity if deported to the DRC. The judge found or accepted, ""This gives rise to a very real prospect of further detention in abject conditions."" 24. We accept that the claimant has an appalling criminal history, having amassed some 19 separate convictions for 34 criminal offences between 2004 and 2014. In January 2009 he was convicted of possession with intent to supply Class A (cocaine) and Class B (cannabis) controlled drugs, for which he was sentenced to a total term of four years in a Young Offender Institute. During and even after his release from that sentence, he continued to offend, albeit to a lesser degree. He was also a member of a known criminal gang, though the First-tier Tribunal accepted that he was not particularly high in the hierarchy. He had also been given an Osman warning in 2017. The deportation order was made on the basis of the four year sentence, on the basis that his deportation was conducive to the public good. 25. In essence, the argument is that because the claimant has previously been convicted of drugs offences, despite all the suggestions in the evidence adduced on his behalf that he is now a reformed character and would remain drug-free, he should not be removed from the UK because he would go on to commit criminal offences in the DRC, leading to his prosecution and imprisonment in what are accepted would be conditions infringing Article 3. 26. The argument is further advanced in Mr Sellwood's post-hearing written submissions. It is not necessary to rehearse the well-established legal principles elaborated upon by Mr Sellwood, which are not in contention, but we readily accept that if there is a real risk of a person being subjected to degrading or inhuman treatment in a particular country so as to amount to an infringement of article 3, that would constitute an absolute prohibition on expulsion, even if the risk arises from the subject's conduct or activity, and even if such activity is conducted in bad faith. In SSHD v Iftikhar Ahmed [1999] EWCA Civ 3003, the Court of Appeal concluded that if an asylum seeker would in fact do things after return which would put them at real risk of persecution for a Convention reason, there is an entitlement to protection, however unreasonable the conduct. In HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31, the Supreme Court held that attention must be focused on what the claimant would actually do if returned to his country of nationality. The fact that he could take action to avoid persecution does not disentitled him from asylum if in fact he will not act in such a way as to avoid it, even if to fail to do so would be unreasonable. 27. We accept that article 3 is a non-derogable right prohibiting in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person seeking to rely on such protection. However, we find Mr Sellwood's submissions and the supporting legal authorities he cites fall short of supporting the basis upon which Judge Bart-Stewart allowed the appeal under article 3, namely that the claimant would be vulnerable to further drug use and criminal behaviour so as to give rise to the prospect of detention in conditions infringing article 3. We accept as well-made the Secretary of State's argument that the protection of article 3 cannot properly be construed so as to protect those who freely choose criminal conduct that if pursued would give rise to a real risk of treatment infringing article 3. We accept that a distinction must sensibly be drawn between on the one hand those who cannot help but, or who are alternatively entitled to, conduct themselves in a way that gives rise to a risk of treatment infringing article 3, and on the other those who choose to commit crime or engage in other anti-social and illegal activity through personal choice and/or for financial gain. Whilst even the most serious public policy considerations cannot override the absolute prohibition on treatment infringing article 3, there is an important and significant public policy consideration that to construe the protection of article 3 in the way the First-tier Tribunal Judge did and for which Mr Sellwood contends would incentivise criminal conduct in the UK by claimants seeking to avoid deportation. 28. We readily understand and accept that the claimant would not have the same stable support structure available to him as he has in the UK and on any view the risk of recidivism must be greater in the DRC than in the UK. We also acknowledge that to an extent both parties are trying to have their cake and eat it. For example, the Secretary of State relies on the risk the claimant presents for the protection of the public by reason of his drug dealing convictions as being sufficient to deport him but at the same time, in reliance on the suggestion that he would not face a risk of return to offending on return, points out that there was no evidence that he is a drug addict or took anything other than cannabis whilst dealing in the harder drug of cocaine. We note the claimant's own evidence, summarised at [119-120] of the decision, is that he had relocated away from his gang or peer associations and had not reoffended since 2014. 29. We find the core argument untenable, unsupported as it is by any legal authority or precedent. This is not an argument of double jeopardy where the claimant would face further punishment in the DRC for the crimes he committed and for which he was sentenced in the UK. Neither is this a situation akin to HJ (Iran) principles where a returnee is entitled to pursue his political opinion, faith or sexual orientation; we cannot accept that the claimant has the right to protection because he is inherently criminal or might in the future behave like a criminal. It is one thing to accept that if imprisoned because of his past behaviour he would face a real risk of incarceration in conditions infringing Article 3, but it is entirely another to suggest that because he is of criminal inclination or outlook the tribunal must proceed on the expectation that he would commit further criminal offences in the DRC and in due course find himself detained in inhuman conditions. If this argument were to be adopted in principle, it would prove almost impossible to return to a wide range of countries around the world any person being deported on the basis of having committed serious criminal offences in the UK. We find no authority for the proposition that one must look to see whether a returnee is likely to or might commit further offences so as face the risk of incarceration in unacceptable conditions infringing Article 3. In any event, we find such a risk is speculative and far too remote.30. It will be the claimant's free choice whether to continue to commit criminal offences on return. In the circumstances, we do not accept that any propensity to reoffend can be equated to an imputed or innate characteristic, such as mental ill-health, or a genuinely held belief, such as political opinion or religious faith. Committing crime is not central to the claimant's identity such as to entitle him to international protection from the consequences of a deliberate choice to offend. In our view, he cannot sensibly be entitled to international protection against the consequences of any future criminal conduct. As stated in SE (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 256, an offender cannot rely upon his own partially unreformed criminality as a factor relevant (in that case) to either his family or private life. Article 3 was not argued in that case. 31. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, we find each aspect of the First-tier Tribunal Article 3 considerations flawed and as the judge combined them at [128] to reach the conclusion that the high threshold had been reached, the decision on Article 3 was made in material error of law. Article 8 Consideration - Very Compelling Circumstances32. We also heard Mr Lindsay's detailed arguments as to the Article 8 very compelling circumstances considerations set out in the decision from [129] onwards. We accept that on the facts of this case there is a considerable degree of overlap between Articles 3 and 8. At [134] the judge relied on: the claimant's young age when he left the DRC and formative upbringing in the UK; a finding that there would be very significant obstacles to his integration in the DRC (based on Dr Kodi's opinion); that he has no family in the DRC; that he ""does not speak the language;"" and has no accommodation or means of support. The judge went on to note that the claimant poses a moderate to low risk of reoffending, which will remain the case if he continues on the path of rehabilitation and lifestyle change. 33. Mr Lindsay highlighted concern at [134] where the judge stated ""The offending history in itself does not prevent him being socially and culturally integrated in the UK,"" which does not seem to acknowledge that the claimant's long criminal record, including offences before and after the index offence as well as offences of violence whilst in prison, and the serious nature of his offending, runs counter to a claim of social and cultural integration in the UK. In Binbuga the Court of Appeal specifically held that gang membership tells against social integration and that integration connotes integration as a law-abiding citizen, referring to a 'discontinuity in integration,' by the commission of criminal offences. Further, Binbuga held that rehabilitation carries little or no weight in the proportionality balancing exercise. The tribunal did not take these considerations into account. 34. In his submissions that the First-tier Tribunal failed to carry out a 'broad evaluative judgement,' Mr Lindsay also drew a comparison with the facts in Bossade (ss117A-D interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415 (IAC), where the Upper Tribunal found no very significant obstacles to integration in circumstances where the DRC citizen came to the UK age 4 and lived in the UK for the following 25 years, did not speak Lingala and had no family in the DRC. It was submitted that the claimant is in a stronger position on return than Mr Bossade. 35. Mr Sellwood's submitted that the Article 8 conclusion of very compelling circumstances could survive a finding that the Article 3 assessment was flawed. His submissions largely sought to rely on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, particularly the reports of Dr Kofi and Dr Lackenby. We accept that a holistic approach must be taken to the decision as a whole rather than the piecemeal criticism in some of Mr Lindsay's submissions. However, the issue before us is not whether the available evidence was sufficient to justify the findings made but whether the findings made were sufficient to justify allowing the appeal on either or both Article 3 or Article 8, applying the correct legal principles, or whether the way in which reliance on those findings was approached was flawed so as to amount to a material error of law. 36. Having heard from and taken into account the submissions of both counsel, we accept that the Article 8 assessment and the factors relied on by the judge did in general terms amount to a broad evaluative judgement of the evidence but find that the analysis failed to accord adequate weight to the public interest, whilst giving undue weight to factors in the claimant's favour, at least some of which were either neutral factors or not objectively capable of being accorded significant weight, such as rehabilitation or the fact that the claimant can speak but is not fully fluent in Lingala. 37. Further, it is clear from the wording of paragraph [141] of the decision that in reaching her conclusions on article 8 the judge had regard to the circumstances the claimant would face on return, including that he was not fluent in the local language, before stating, ""taken together I consider that these are compelling circumstances."" Not only did the judge fail to apply the relevant threshold of ""very compelling circumstances,"" but it is clear that the flawed Article 3 findings were so entwined with the Article 8 considerations that it is impossible to separate out a decision which we could find would have justified a judge allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds independently of the flawed Article 3 findings. Mr Sellwood accepted that given the terms of paragraph [141], it would be difficult to sustain his argument that the Article 8 findings could survive independently. It is clear that the entire considerations in relation to both Article 3 and Article 8 will need to be remade.38. In the circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal cannot stand and must be set aside to be remade. Remittal39. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside, section 12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal with directions, or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of primary fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. The errors infecting the First-tier Tribunal decision vitiates all other findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been a valid determination of the issues in the appeal. 40. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, we do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. Decision41. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision should be set aside. We set aside the decision. We remit the appeal to be decided afresh in the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with the attached directions.

5,PA/12260/2018," Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/12260/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at: Field House Decision & Reasons Promulgated  On: 29 May 2019 On: 03 June 2019      Before UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KEBEDE Between FC (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE) Appellant and SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr P Blackwood, instructed by Morgan Pearse Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS This case involves a cross-appeal, with both parties appealing the First-tier Tribunal’s decision of 6 February 2019. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 10 February 1960. Following various visits in 2009, July 2014, April 2016, December 2016 and November 2017, the appellant entered the UK on 29 March 2018 and claimed asylum on 16 April 2018. Her claim was refused on 9 October 2018 and her appeal against that decision was heard in the First-tier Tribunal on 20 November 2018. The appellant’s claim can be summarised as follows. In 1997 she moved to Tirana with her husband and two young sons. Her husband purchased a piece of land but the sale had been fraudulent as the seller was not the rightful owner. He came to an agreement with the rightful owner and they made a home on the land. One night a masked man came to their house and threatened to kill them. Four days later the same man returned with two others and he fired 72 bullets at them, leading to her husband’s death in hospital four days later. The appellant was herself shot twice in the leg. Once she was discharged from hospital the appellant took her two children and moved to her husband’s family home. Six months after her husband’s murder three men were arrested and all were convicted. The appellant testified at their trial and identified one of them, AL, as having been the masked intruder who had later killed her husband. One of the men was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and another to six months. AL was sentenced to 23 years. Two of his relatives came to speak to the appellant and to her brother asking to settle the matter by withdrawing her claim but she refused. AL was released from prison in 2016. In December 2016 a stone was thrown through the window of their third floor apartment. Three days later her neighbour told her that two men had asked her which apartment belonged to her and a week later, on 30 November 2016, two men banged on her door at half past midnight and shouted at her to open the door, but she did not. She reported the matter to the police and went to the town council who dealt with reconciliations but they said they were unable to help. On 26 February 2018 an attempt was made to kidnap her when she was waiting at a bus stop but a young man helped her and took her to the police station and then to her home. Her brother told her that this was the last time that she could bring such problems to his home and her neighbour told her that she could not stay there. She left Albania and came to the UK. She believed that a blood feud had been declared against her as a result of her refusing to withdraw her testimony against the three men. The respondent accepted, from the documents produced by the appellant, that her husband had been murdered by the three men but did not accept her account of threats and harassment from the men and did not accept that she was the victim of a blood feud. The respondent did not accept that the appellant was at risk on return to Albania either on account of a blood feud or as a lone female. It was considered in any event that there was sufficiency of protection available to the appellant and that she could internally relocate to another part of Albania. It was not accepted that the appellant’s removal to Albania would breach her human rights. The appellant’s appeal against that decision was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke. The judge commented that the murder of the appellant’s husband was particularly brutal and noted that the murder had happened in front of the appellant’s children and that the appellant had been shot twice in the legs. The judge noted that the appellant had produced a number of documents as proof of her claim and accepted that she was a key eye witness in the trial of the three men and helped secure their convictions. The judge referred to records of reports made by the appellant to the police, in respect of the incidents on 30 November 2018 and 26 February 2018 and a document entitled “certificate” from the Mufti of Diber dated 25 November 2016 confirming the appellant’s husband’s murder. The judge accepted that the documents were consistent with the appellant’s claim and accepted that the appellant had been harassed by AL. The judge noted the reference to a blood feud in the letter from the Mufti of Diber as well as in a letter dated 30 November 2017 from the Head of the Administration Unit of Peshkopi and noted that a letter dated 23 November 2017 from the Head of the Administration Unit of Maqellare confirmed that they could not offer the appellant protection. However, with reference to the country guidance in EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 348, the judge did not accept that the appellant’s situation constituted a blood feud but that it was a matter of a criminal gang who had murdered her husband and who now harassed her and that she was a victim of criminal behaviour. The judge did not accept that the appellant was a member of a particular social group as a victim of a blood feud or as a lone female and did not accept that she had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Neither did the judge accept that the appellant qualified for humanitarian protection or that Articles 2 and 3 applied, as he concluded that there was a sufficiency of protection available to her from the Albanian authorities. With regard to Article 8, however, the judge found that there were very significant obstacles to the appellant reintegrating into life in Albania for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the immigration rules, based upon the trauma of her past experiences, her mental health problems, her fear of AL and his criminal associates and the harassment she experienced from them. The judge found that accordingly the appellant’s removal to Albania amounted to a disproportionate interference with her Article 8 rights and he allowed the appeal on that basis. He dismissed the appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds. Both parties sought permission to appeal against the respective decisions of the judge. With regard to the judge’s decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds, the respondent relied, in his grounds, upon the case of Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 and asserted that the judge’s findings on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) were insufficiently reasoned. As for the decision to dismiss the appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds, the appellant’s grounds asserted that the judge had erred in his identification of a particular social group (PSG); that the judge had made a material misdirection of law in finding that the appellant was the victim of criminal behaviour and not a blood feud and that his analysis of the EH blood feuds factors was incomplete; and that the judge had erred in finding that the Albanian state was unable and/or unwilling to protect the appellant. Permission was granted to the respondent by the First-tier Tribunal and also by the Upper Tribunal to the appellant on the last two grounds. Appeal hearing and submissions Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge had erred in law in his consideration of the factors in EH and that the documentary evidence referring to a blood feud should have been properly addressed as supporting the appellant’s case. Mr Blackwood referred to the Home Office Country Policy and Information Note (CPIN) on “Albania: Blood feuds” version 3.0 dated October 2018 which in turn referred, at paragraph 3.4.4, to the conclusion in the Cedoca report 2017, in regard to the difficulties in defining a blood feud. As for the second ground of appeal, Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge had erred in his consideration of sufficiency of protection. He referred to Horvath v. Secretary of State For The Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 in that regard and submitted that the presumption of innocence arising in the case of Osman v. United Kingdom - 23452/94 [1998] ECHR 101 was not applicable in the appellant’s case as her husband’s killer was not presumed innocent. There was ample evidence that the killer was ruthless and determined. The Albanian state had a duty to protect the appellant but failed to take steps to protect her after she reported the harassment to them. The judge, in finding that there was a sufficiency of protection, relied upon the actions of the police in relation to the appellant’s husband’s murder, but did not address the appellant’s fear of her own murder. Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge’s decision on the appellant’s asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 2 and 3 claims ought accordingly to be set aside and re-made. Mr Lindsay relied upon the CPIN in submitting that the judge was correct in reaching the conclusion that he did as to the existence of a blood feud. He referred to paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of the CPIN in regard to the evolution of blood feuds and the fact that they were declining and were often just criminal acts. He submitted that the letters upon which the appellant relied were reflected by those parts of the CPIN and supported the judge’s finding that this was a matter of criminals trying to seek revenge rather than a blood feud. As for the second ground, Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge reached a sustainable decision and that the appellant was simply seeking to re-argue the matter. In regard to the respondent’s grounds of appeal in relation to Article 8, Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge had provided insufficient reasoning as to why the factors mentioned at [104] and [105] of his decision amounted to very significant obstacles to integration for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), and that those factors were not rationally capable of meeting the terms of Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813. Mr Blackwood submitted that the respondent’s submissions did not reflect the grounds of appeal which were based upon Shizad. The judge undertook a broad evaluative judgment and the findings made were open to him on the evidence. The judge set out the obstacles to integration which included the effect of the trauma of witnessing her husband’s murder with her children. The GP’s letter confirmed her mental health issues arising from the incident. The judge was entitled to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds. Mr Blackwood responded to Mr Lindsay’s submissions on the interpretation of a blood feud and sufficiency of protection, relying on the references in the Cedoca report to the Albanian authorities being insufficiently active in prevention of crimes and addressing blood feuds. Consideration and findings I do not find the grounds of challenge to be made out for either party. It seems to me that the grounds, as put to me at the hearing, amount to little more than disagreements with the judge’s decision. Mr Blackwood’s submission in regard to the findings on the existence of a blood feud was that the judge failed to explain why the letters produced by the appellant, which specifically referred to the existence of a blood feud, were not accepted as supporting the case that a blood feud existed and why the appellant’s case was not accepted as meeting the relevant factors in EH in that regard. The letters referred to are as follows. At page 46 to 48 of the appellant’s appeal bundle, a “Certificate” dated 25 November 2016 from the Mufti of Diber on behalf of the Muslim Community of Albania confirming in the last paragraph: “Situated in this drama, Madam FC and her sons are endangered by blood feud phenomenon as this phenomenon is a widespread drama in Albania.” At pages 49 to 52, a “Record” dated 30 November 2016 from the Dibra District Prosecutor’s Office of the appellant’s report to the police of the incident on 29 November 2016 in which she refers to her family being in a blood feud. At pages 54 to 55, an “Attestation” dated 30 November 2016 from the Chairman of the Administrative Unit of Peshkopi stating that “Mrs FC is seriously endangered by the phenomenon of blood feud” and that “we cannot defend the life of this respected citizen”. At pages 56 to 57, an “Attestation” dated 2 December 2016 from the Mayor of the Municipality of Diber referring to the “conflict between the parties” continuing. The judge referred to these documents at [81], when considering whether the harassment against the appellant amounted to a blood feud. At [82] the judge went on to consider the factors set out in EH at paragraph 74(f) which are to be applied in determining whether a blood feud exists and at [86] he considered the factors in paragraph 74(g) of EH. Having assessed all the evidence, the judge then provided reasons for concluding that the circumstances did not amount to a blood feud. Whilst the judge did not specifically respond to the references in the various official letters to a blood feud, it is undeniably the case that he had regard to those letters in making his findings. It is to be noted that [9] of EH states that such documents “may” assist in establishing the existence of a blood feud and, furthermore, I find myself in agreement with Mr Lindsay that the relevant issue is not so much whether the authorities consider it appropriate to use such a term but whether the term of “blood feud” is correct in this jurisdiction. I also agree with Mr Lindsay that the paragraphs in the CPIN to which he referred support the judge’s analysis of the appellant’s circumstances, in particular at paragraph 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, and specifically: 3.3.1: “… Alfred Koçobashi stated that blood feud still occurs “when someone innocent, a third party has to pay the price for the damage a family member has done, but he added that since the 1990s it is not about honour anymore. 80% is criminal and not related to customary law or medieval common law. It’s about mafia-style killings. It’s murder cases for other reasons than blood feud, just like they happen elsewhere. It’s normal killings or vendetta killings.” Elsa Ballauri from the Albanian Human Rights Group (AHRG) also referred to the transformation of blood feud: …She also declared: “It’s more a justification nowadays because they are committing crimes and they say: ‘I did it for blood feud’. But for me, none of the cases after the 1990s is a real blood feud case.”” 3.3.2: ‘The General Director from the Albanian State Police also stated that revenge cases, that most often are the consequence of criminal problems and individual conflicts or disputes, can happen to everyone and everywhere and are very often wrongly labelled as blood feud… ‘” In the circumstances I find no error of law in the judge’s assessment of whether a blood feud existed and in his conclusion that the events were related to criminal activity and amounted to a criminal vendetta rather than a blood feud. Accordingly I uphold his decision in that regard. Turning to the question of sufficiency of protection, I accept the point being made by Mr Blackwood, namely that the issue was not that the Albanian authorities had demonstrated a willingness to take action against the appellant’s husband’s killers, but whether they were willing and able to take preventative measures to prevent the appellant’s murder. Mr Blackwood relied upon the letters from the Albanian authorities in submitting that they were not able to take such measures, that the police had not taken action against AL and his associates when they harassed the appellant and that the judge ought to have concluded as such on the evidence. The appellant’s grounds at [34] challenge in particular the judge’s finding at [85] of his decision in relation to a document entitled “Decision for the Non-Initiation of the Criminal Proceeding” from the Judicial Attorney of Diber at page 63 and 64 of the appellant’s appeal bundle. However the judge plainly gave detailed and careful consideration to the matter and had full regard to the implications of the decision in that document, as well as the other documentary evidence, in light of the guidance in Horvath. At [93] to [95] the judge considered the matter further in the context of the background country information, noting the limitations of the Albanian police force but providing cogent reasons for concluding nevertheless that the police would prosecute AL and his associates if there was evidence that they had been involved in harassing the appellant. Plainly the documentary evidence showed that the police investigated the appellant’s allegations of harassment and for the reasons properly given the judge was unarguably entitled to conclude that there was a sufficiency of protection available to the appellant to the Horvath standard. I agree with Mr Lindsay that the challenge to the judge’s decision in this regard is no more than a disagreement with his properly made findings and again I uphold his decision. Turning next to the Secretary of State’s appeal against the judge’s decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds, I agree with Mr Blackwood that, whilst the challenge was said to be on the basis of an insufficiency of reasoning, the submission made by Mr Lindsay strayed into the realms of rationality. In any event I find no merit in either grounds of challenge. At [104] of his decision the judge had full regard to the relevant caselaw in considering the question of very significant obstacles to integration into life in Albania and followed the guidance in Kamara in conducting a “broad evaluative judgment”. At [104] and [105] he gave detailed reasons as to why he reached the conclusions that he did. Whilst the respondent may not agree that those reasons are sufficient to amount to very significant obstacles to integration, there is no dispute as to the facts behind those reasons and the various matters considered by the judge, including the appellant’s mental health, were supported by the evidence. There was no insufficiency of reasoning and neither was there anything irrational about the judge’s conclusions, which were clearly and unarguably based upon the evidence before him. There are accordingly no grounds upon which to conclude that the judge made any error of law in concluding as he did. I therefore uphold the judge’s decision in that respect. DECISION Accordingly, both appeals are dismissed. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a point of law, such that the decision has to be set aside. I do not set aside the decision. The decision to dismiss the appellant’s appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 grounds and to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds therefore stands. Anonymity The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 13 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.

This appeal is subject to an anonymity order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead to members of the public identifying the appellant or his children. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. Introduction2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on 14 July 1976. He is a Kurd and comes from Sulaymaniyeh in the IKR. 3. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2013 as a student with a visa to undertake a PhD at Nottingham University funded by a scholarship from the Baghdad government. His wife and three children joined him in the UK in April 2013. His visa was subsequently extended until 30 January 2018 in order to allow him to complete his studies.4. On 1 November 2017, the appellant claimed asylum based upon his political opinion as a result, he said, of threats due to his political social media posting against the government in the IKR. 5. On 24 April 2018, the Secretary of State refused the appellant's claims for asylum, humanitarian protection and under the ECHR. 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In a determination sent on 23 August 2018, Judge Lever dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds including under Art 8.7. The appellant sought permission to appeal solely against the dismissal of his appeal under Art 8. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal on 28 September 2018 but on 4 December 2018 the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Chalkley) granted the appellant permission to appeal.8. On 29 February 2019, the appeal was initially listed before me as an error of law hearing. At that hearing, the Secretary of State conceded that Judge Lever had failed adequately to consider the appellant's Art 8 claim, in particular the impact of the appellant's removal upon his children specifically his twin boys ('A' and 'M') aged 7 who have been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (""ASD"") and have special educational needs.9. In a determination sent on 13 March 2019, in agreement with the Secretary of State's concession, I set aside Judge Lever's decision in relation to Art 8 directing that the decision be remade by the Upper Tribunal at a further hearing at which further evidence could be submitted in respect of the children's circumstances.The Resumed Hearing10. The appeal was listed before me on 9 May 2019. At that hearing, the appellant was represented by Ms L Profumo and the Secretary of State by Mr C Howells. 11. The sole issue was whether the appellant could establish a breach of Art 8.12. Both representatives sought to admit new evidence under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended). Both applications were unopposed. 13. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Profumo relied upon a report from the special needs school at which the appellant's twins A and M were now placed. 14. In addition, Ms Profumo relied upon in translation a letter from the appellant's former employer, Sulaymaniyeh University - where he had been a lecturer before coming to the UK - which indicated that due to his unauthorised absence from work following the completion of his period of study vacation, if he did not return within 30 days from being abroad, he would be considered as ""resigning"" from his position. That letter is dated 5 May 2018.15. Mr Howells relied upon the CPIN, Iraq: Medical and Healthcare Issues (May 2019); and two news reports printed from the internet concerned, inter alia, with the provision for those with autism in the IKR.16. I heard brief oral evidence from the appellant himself. 17. I heard oral submissions from both Ms Profumo and Mr Howells. Ms Profumo handed up a detailed and helpful skeleton argument setting out the appellant's case.The Issues18. It was common ground between the parties that the appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) either under Appendix FM or on the basis of his private life and para 276ADE. It was also accepted that none of the appellant's children - in addition to the twins he also has a daughter (""S"") aged 13 - nor his wife could succeed under the Rules. 19. A number of matters were common ground between the parties.20. First, the appellant's claim was a claim under Art 8 outside the Rules. Secondly, the appellant's claim was based upon his (and his family's) private life in the UK, in particular the impact upon his twin sons if he were removed to the IKR. The reality in this appeal is that either all the family stay in the UK or all the family leave and return to the IKR. Mr Howells did not suggest otherwise in his submissions. Thirdly, the crucial issue was that of proportionality under Art 8.2. It was not suggested, nor could it be on the basis of the evidence, that Art.8.1 was not engaged based upon the impact upon the family if they returned to the IKR. Both representatives agreed that the crucial issue in determining whether any interference was proportionate was whether there were sufficiently compelling circumstances which would result in ""unjustifiably harsh consequences"" for the appellant or his family (see, R (Agyarko and Another) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 at [60]).The Submissions21. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Howells submitted that s.117B(1) and (5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the ""NIA Act 2002"") was important. As the appellant and his family could not meet any of the requirements of the Rules, the maintenance of effective immigration control was in the public interest by virtue of s.117B(1). Further, the private life of the appellant and his family had been established whilst their immigration status was ""precarious"" and, therefore, should be given ""little weight"" by virtue of s.117B(5).22. Mr Howells recognised that the principal aspect of the appellant's claim related to the impact of removal of his twins, A and M who have a diagnosis of ASD. Mr Howells accepted that the background evidence showed that there was ""limited"" support for autism in the IKR but, he submitted, there was some provision. He referred me to a number of documents. 23. First, he referred me to the ""Cara Report: A Study of Education Opportunities for Disabled Children and Youth and Early Childhood Development (ECD) in Iraq (April 2011)"" at pages CB 40-82 of the appellant's bundle. At CB 73 he referred to a section relating to the IKR under the heading ""schools"" identifying a higher percentage of special needs teachers with formal special needs training showing the ""growing effectiveness of the Kurdistan Inclusion Education Programme (KIEP)"". Then at CB 50, the KIEP programme is discussed including referring to the provision of an ""early learning programme"" for children with disabilities. Then at CB 65-66 further reference is made to special needs teachers, albeit on an Iraq wide basis rather than specifically in the IKR, but also notes that the KIEP nevertheless had opposition from ""some members of the Erbil Provincial Counsel, who view KIEP as pushing a western 'construct'.""24. Secondly, Mr Howells referred to the very recent May 2019 CPIN report at para 15.1.1 referring to the existence of ""private institutions"" for individuals with autism and Downs Syndrome charging $250 monthly. When I enquired of Mr Howell whether this related to the IKR or the remainder of Iraq, he was unable to assist.25. Thirdly, he referred me to the two newspaper reports arising out of 'World Autism Awareness Day' in 2019 and the provision of ""twenty autism-designed centers in the Kurdistan region, seventeen of which are private."" He accepted however that provision did not meet demand. Mr Howells was unable to assist as to whether these ""autism-designed centers"" provided education or, as would appear from the text, some form of ""treatment"" for children with autism.26. Mr Howells submitted that the appellant could generate income in order to allow his twins to attend one of these autism-designed centers. He had been a lecturer in Sulaymaniyeh University and now had a PhD. 27. Mr Howells submitted that, despite what the appellant said in his evidence, it was likely that the children had, at least initially, spoken Kurdish before and not just, as the appellant claimed, and the recent report stated, they now spoke English. 28. Mr Howells submitted that, having regard to all these circumstances, there were no compelling circumstances giving rise to unjustifiably harsh consequences to the family, in particular the twin boys, A and M so as to outweigh the public interest. 29. Ms Profumo relied upon her very detailed skeleton argument. She submitted that the twin had initially been in a mainstream school but had even there they had required 1:1 support. It had been recommended that they should have special educational provision and that in September 2018, they had been placed in a specialist school. She referred me to a letter from the head teacher dated 3 April 2019 which indicated that the ratio was six pupils: three adults. But, she submitted it was clear that they still required 1:1 support on specific occasions. 30. Ms Profumo placed considerable reliance upon the report from the specialist school which showed that both A and M were progressing and thriving relative to their progress whilst they were in a mainstream school. She submitted that they were both in a highly supportive environment which would simply not be available in the IKR. She submitted that the background material showed that there was a dearth of special educational provision, albeit that there was some within the mainstream context. There was no evidence that there were any specialist schools of the kind which both A and M required and at which they were placed in the UK. She submitted that the twins could not cope with mainstream school in the UK and they would not be able to do so in the IKR. The evidence about private institution was that they were essentially treatment or support centres. Nothing in the material suggested that they were educational institutions such as the one attended by the twins in the UK. She pointed out that the evidence showed that there were 2,800 cases of children diagnosed with autism in the IKR. The second letter made plain that there was ""not enough support centres or funding to care for them"". She submitted that the private provision was not, in itself, adequate for the children but in any event the appellant would not be able to afford to place his children there. It was expensive and his evidence, which he invited me to accept, was that he was unlikely to be able to obtain a job. 31. She relied not only upon the impact upon A and M but also upon the appellant's daughter, S and his wife. They had been in the UK for over six years, the twins were 1 year old when they came and S was 7. The evidence was, she submitted, that the children spoke English, in particular in the report of the school which the twins now attended.32. She submitted, relying upon matters set out in paras 9-20 of her skeleton in relation to A and M and in para 21 in relation to S and para 22 in relation to the appellant and his wife, that the appellant's removal would not be in the best interests of the three children and, particularly having regard to the impact upon A and M, there were sufficiently compelling circumstances to outweigh the public interest as there would be an unjustifiably harsh consequence to them if returned to the IKR. Discussion33. I deal first with the appellant's oral evidence. I accept what he told me. I have no doubt that he was seeking to tell me the truth. He, like his wife, was employed at Sulaymaniyeh University before they came to the UK. I accept his oral evidence supported by the letter dated 7 May 2018, that he has now been sacked. He told me in his oral evidence that two further letters had confirmed that he had been sacked but he had not produced them. Mr Howells did not seek to cross-examine him on this matter to suggest that he was not telling the truth and, as I say, I accept that he has lost his job. I also accept his evidence that his wife has lost her job as well. I accept further that it will be very difficult for them to obtain employment, certainly employment permitting them to afford any private support for their twins A and M, on return to the IKR. I also accept the appellant's evidence that his family in the IKR would not be able to provide the required finance for private support for the twins. I accept his evidence that his three brothers are unemployed, his parents are very old and his two sisters are married living with their husbands and family. None are employed and they are uneducated. 34. Ms Profumo helpfully set out the evidence concerning M and A at paras 9-16 of her skeleton argument. Mr Howells acknowledged her summary of their circumstances is accurate. They have both been diagnosed with ASD and suffer from sensory and developmental needs. The appellant's own evidence, which I accept, was that: ""everything is difficult for them, eating, changing clothes, going to the toilet?if they meet strangers who do not understand how to deal with autism, they cry, they shout, sometimes they run away"".35. Both children have, until September of last year, been in a mainstream school. They have been assessed as requiring special educational needs, including 1:1 teacher support. The needs of M are more acute than those of his brother A. As I have said, Mr Howells acknowledged as accurate Ms Profumo's summary of M and A's circumstances set out at paras 11-14 of her skeleton argument. There, she very carefully, and in detail by reference to the documents upon which she places reliance, sets out their circumstances. I accept what she sets out and I gratefully adopt it (with removal of her emphasis and identifying information, and with some typographical/citation corrections) as part of my decision. (The reference to the ""EHCP"" reviews in relation to both M and A is to their respective ""Education, Health & Care Plan"" review in the appellant's bundle (""AB"").) ""11, The EHCP review of [M], dated 30 March 2017 [AB/127-137], who suffers from the most acute needs, identifies the following concerns:i. He shows no awareness or interest in other children and reciprocal activities [AB/A129&130].ii. His speech is unclear and easier to understand by adults 'tuned into him' [A129].iii. He continues to require 1:1 support to facilitate access to all areas of curriculum, as well as for health and safety [AB/A135].iv. He requires help to dress and undress [AB/A131].v. Continues to require close supervision and clear explicit boundaries to remain safe at all times [AB/A131].vi. ""As the gap between [M] and his peers widens, his reliance on an adult to access the curriculum at [?] is unlikely to reduce which will impact on [M's] ability to develop greater independence"" [AB/135].vii. His progress has been minimal despite the high level of sustained support he receives [AB/A135].viii. The school does not have the capacity to meet [M's] needs appropriately or to provide the level of support he requires to increase to his time to a full-time place [AB/A132].ix. [M] requires a specialist school setting, with smaller class sizes, a higher ratio of staff support, and a peer group with similar needs with whom he is best placed to access learning [AB/A135].x. The benefits of a move to specialist school would be ""greater focus on communication, interaction, and life skills"", and in the long-term greater independence on reduced reliance on an adult [AB/A135].12. The parallel EHCP review of [A] [AB/A146-154] identifies the following concerns:i. He does not initiate or respond to peers [AB/A148].ii. Even with his 1:1 support, it is difficult for him to remain seated for more than 2-3 minutes [A149].iii. He will take every opportunity to test the boundaries [A150].iv. He continues to need 1:1 full time support to engage in curriculum activities and for health and safety [AB/A152].v. ""As the gap between [A] and his peers widens, his reliance on an adult to access the curriculum at [?] is unlikely to reduce which will impact on [M's] ability to develop greater independence"" [AB/A153]vi. The school does not have the capacity to meet [A's] needs appropriately or to provide the level of support he requires to increase his time to a full-time place [AB/A151].vii. [A] requires a specialist school setting as [?] unable to provide an environment and curriculum conducive to his progress; he would benefit from smaller, specialist classes with peers with similar needs [AB/A153].13. The twins were thereafter admitted to [?] Primary School, a mainstream school in Bristol, on 11 September 2017, where they are similarly supported with SEN [see letter from SENDco, Ms Williams, at AB/A126]. When the family relocated to Cardiff in February 2018, the local authority re-investigated the children's education needs, with the following observations:""these two boys are very complex and would not do well in a local mainstream school even with full time 1:1 teaching assistant support. They are both very limited verbally (echolalic and key words), PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) users, can be very challenging and have a very limited sense of danger"".They are definitely special Autistic Spectrum Disorder profile pupils. Being without a school placement and daily routine will also be having a significant impact on their wellbeing"" [see letter from Mr Martin, SEN caseworker, AB/125].14. In view of such needs, Cardiff SEN Casework Team advised [t]hat the twins required specialist educational provision for those on the autism spectrum [AB/125]. This was corroborated by the proposed amended statements of special education needs (date June 2018), which advised:(a) [M]:(i) Unable to independently access any aspect of the curriculum [AB/A190].(ii) Only able to concentrate on activities with a high degree of structure and support [AB/A190].(iii) His speech is unclear and best understood by those families with him [AB/A190].(iv) He doesn't initiate interaction with other children [AB/A190].(v) He suffers from ASD and certain sensory needs, his special educational needs likely due to his communication and language difficulties [AB/A190].(vi) He will require specialist education provision that provides a high level of individual/small group teaching, with a high adult-pupil ratio, and staff experienced/trained in managing the needs of children with autism spectrum condition and with appropriate interventions [AB/A191].(vii) He should also have access to a clinical-based Speech & language Therapist [AB/A191].(viii) He will require close supervision for his own safety, and help with his independence skills such as dressing [AB/A192].(ix) There should be close liaison between the school, home and outside agencies to ensure a consistent approach and regularly review [M's] progress [AB/A192].(b) [A]:(i) He has limited speech, requiring adults to model short phrases and develop his language [AB/A199].(ii) He suffers from ASD and his certain sensory needs, his special education needs likely due to his difficulties with his social communication and language [AB/199].(iii) He will require specialist educational provision that provides a high level of individual/small group teaching, with a high adult-pupil ratio, and staff experienced/trained in managing the needs of children with autism spectrum condition and with appropriate interventions [AB/A200].(iv) He should also have access to a clinical-based Speech & Language Therapist [AB/A200].(v) He will require close supervision for his own safety with the school needing to complete a risk assessment [AB/A200].(vi) There should be close liaison between the school, home and outside agencies to ensure a consistent approach and regularly review [A's] progress [AB/A201].""36. Since September 2018, they have attended a specialist school in Cardiff and the position there is summarised at paras 15 and 16 of Ms Profumo's skeleton argument as follows.""15. The twins accordingly started at the [?] Special School in September 2018, a specialist school for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Condition [AB/A125; A186]. ?. further evidence has been submitted?of the twins' most recent annual review at their new school [SB]. [?], the head teacher, confirms both pupils receive their education in a small class setting, with a high adult-pupil ratio (1:2). She observes both children:""have social communication and social interaction challenges and require 1:1 support at specific times of the school day in order to access the curriculum and to develop life skills required within their development stage"" [SB].16. The recent school reviews of both children [SB] confirm they have thrived within their specialist education settings as relative to their progress in the former mainstream schools:(a) [M](i) He has made good progress in engaging with activities.(ii) He benefits from the structured play in the classroom environment and engages well with the individual/class schedules [page 8].(iii) He has made good progress with self-help skills, able to put his coat on and toilet independently.(iv) His numeracy and literacy skills have improved.(b) [A]:(i) He has improved his communication skills, showing a clear understanding of spoken language and using increasingly varied spontaneous language [internal page 7/8].(ii) He has made good progress with his early literacy and numeracy skills [page 9].(v) He is able to complete a variety of tasks, within a ""highly structured environment"" [page 7].(vi) His concentration is developing when engaged in independent learning [page 7].(vii) His social and play skill are developing [page 8].(viii) He is independent with toileting, though still requires supervision [page 9].(ix) Whilst aware of certain sensory aspects, he remains unaware of the danger so his actions [10].""37. I accept Ms Profumo's submission that the position of M and A has improved at a specialist school for those with a diagnosis of ASD where they obtain a high level of support including where necessary 1:1 support. The level of support is patently high and the improvement is over, an already significant level of special needs provision, which they previously received whilst they were in a mainstream school.38. It is clear to me on the evidence that the level of support that is required and which they receive in the UK will simply not be available in the IKR. Added to which, I accept the appellant's evidence that they only speak English. The confusion of being in a situation where a foreign language (to them) is being spoken can only, on any reading of the material concerned with their particular circumstances, have a deleterious effect upon them. 39. Although Mr Howells sought to identify from the background material support that would be available to the twins in the IKR, he candidly accepted it was ""limited"". The special needs support in mainstream schools is very limited indeed. Ms Profumo referred, as para 18 of her skeleton argument, to a CBS news report, albeit dated 10 August 2008, where it was said that ""the problem for autistic children in Iraq?is that nothing is known about this condition"". It may be that the more recent material shows some improvement. Nevertheless, the USSD 2007 Report states that: ""There were reports that persons with disabilities experienced discrimination due to social stigma?local NGO's reported many children with disabilities dropped out of public school due to insufficient physical access to school buildings, a lack of appropriate learning materials in schools, and a shortage of teachers qualified to work with children of developmental or intellectual disabilities.""40. Whilst the Cara Report recognises that there is some provision within schools in the IKR under the KIEP, it also recognises that there is resistance. The report refers to the ""Average special-needs teacher to special-needs pupil ratio was 1:8, although 14% of the schools visited with special-needs pupils had no special-needs teacher. The remaining 86% had at least one special-education teacher, the majority of whom are female. Most of the special-needs pupils were not integrated within the standard school rooms. Special-needs classes observed were held away from the main classes, and are often located in unsuitable areas within the school building, e.g. in a store room without windows and under a school stairwell. The curriculum being taught was the standard curriculum.""41. This report does not relate exclusively to the IKR although the enquiry included visiting five primary schools in the Erbil governorate (see para 10.9 at CB 65 - 66). It is plain that the provision contemplated would fall far short of that provided to the twins whilst they were being educated in the mainstream in the UK. The latter, however, was insufficient to meet their needs such that they have now been placed in a special needs school where they are provided even more intense and focussed education and support. It is the latter which has resulted in their improvement which Ms Profumo recognised had occurred. They remain, however, desperately in need of that support in order to fulfil their educational and wellbeing needs given their ASD diagnosis. 42. The evidence relied upon by Mr Howells in the two newspaper reports provides little support for any educational provision sufficient to meet the twins needs. Seventeen of the autism designed centers are private. Only three in the IKR are state supported. There is a very real danger that the twins will not be able to access the state provision. I accept the appellant's evidence that he would not be able to afford to send them to the private autism-designed centers whether the cost is US$250 monthly per child or, as the appellant said, he believed, US$500 monthly. The second news report makes the prospect of the twins obtaining the support provided by these centres most unlikely. It states: ""Nearly 1,000 children with autism live in Erbil province, but there is only one center for treatment. It currently cares for 32 children?""43. In any event, it is wholly unclear from these news reports what is the actual provision to children who attend one of the autism-designed centers. The reports speak of ""treatment"" received at the centers. It is far from clear that they are the educational equivalent of what was being received by the twins in mainstream education in the UK, let alone in the specialist school that they now attend and in which they are, on all the evidence I have seen, thriving and doing much better in their development and education. 44. Although I do take into account the impact upon the appellant, his wife and 13 year old daughter if they were removed to the IKR, at least as regards the appellant and his wife, I agree that s.117B(5) means that ""little weight"" should be given to their private life. It may well be also that although S is 13 and has lived in the UK since she was 7, her best interests would be to live with her parents in IKR if they return there in that it would be reasonable to expect her to return with them (see, KO (Nigeria) and Another v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 at [18]). That, however, cannot be said of M and A. It is clearly, in my judgment, in their best interest to remain in the UK given the deleterious effect upon them as a result of the removal of their education and other support for the ASD which would, in my judgment, in all likelihood occur if they return to the IKR. A and M were 1-year old when they came to the UK and they are now 7 years of age. Whilst their private life was also formed whilst their immigration status was ""precarious"", their circumstances (particularly bearing in mind their diagnosis of ASD) falls, in my judgment, for the flexible application of s.117B(5) read with s.117A(2)(a) recognised by the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58 at [49]. There are in my judgment, ""particularly strong features"" relating to their private life and their circumstances which justify giving due weight to the impact upon their private life if removed.45. I am satisfied that the impact upon A and M if removed to the IKR would be substantial, significant and highly deleterious to their education and developmental progress as a result of their ASD. Their current progress would, in all likelihood, be 'stopped in its tracks' resulting in behavioural and other detriments to them which would, necessarily, have a considerable impact upon their family, in particular their parents who would be caring for them. In my judgment, that impact amounts to sufficiently compelling circumstances because of the unjustifiably harsh consequences removal would have for the family, but in particular for A and M in the IKR. As a result, I am satisfied that the circumstances I have set out above outweigh the public interest such that A and M's removal would be a disproportionate interference with their private life. Their removal would breach Art 8 of the ECHR. As it has never been suggested that the appellant, his wife and S should leave the UK if A and M's removal would breach Art 8, the reality is that all of the family cannot lawfully be removed from the UK in accordance with Art 8 of the ECHR. 46. I accordingly remake the decision and allow the appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.Decision47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal on international protection and humanitarian protection grounds stands.48. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal under Art 8 was set aside in the Upper Tribunal's decision sent on 13 March 2019.49.

The appellant was born on 6 June 1993 and is a male citizen of Iran. By a decision dated 7 March 2018, the Secretary of State refused his application for international protection. By a decision promulgated on 19 December 2018, the First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal. The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.2. I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. My reasons for reaching a decision are as follows. First, the decision contains factual errors which is likely have influenced the judge's assessment of the credibility of the appellant's account. At [7], the judge states that:""The question of whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution? must be looked at in the round in the light of all the relevant circumstances and judged against the situation as at the time of the hearing of the appeal particularly and although, as in this case, there is a considerable history of similar application, adverse decisions and unsuccessful appeal?""3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2017. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was his first challenge to the only refusal of his claim for protection. It is simply not the case that there has been a 'considerable history' of previous adverse decisions and unsuccessful appeals. I consider that it is likely that the judge's approach to the credibility of the appellant as a witness has been influenced by this misunderstanding of the facts.4. Secondly, the appellant relied upon an expert report from Dr Kakhki. In his assessment of the report, the judge has fallen into an error of methodology. He states at [15] the expert 'opines upon the level of risk the appellant might face if returned to Iran subjected him coming up to proof on the facts he seeks to rely upon.' Later, at [23], the judge remarks that the report of the expert 'expresses opinion as to risk dependent on an appellant coming up to proof of his assertions which is not happened in this case. I am not bound by or persuaded by [the expert's] report impressive and learn it though it be.' As Mrs Wawaha, who appeared for the appellant, pointed out, the expert report offers helpful background information regarding country conditions in Iran which are not conditional upon the appellant's account being found credible but which the judge has ignored solely because he found that the appellant had not 'come up to proof.' The judge's rejection entirely of the report and its contents for the reason he is given amounts to an error of law.5. Thirdly, the judge failed to have regard to parts of the appellant's account which the Secretary of State had accepted as true and accurate in the refusal letter. At [53] of that letter, the respondent accepts the appellant's nationality and his 'smuggling activities.' Notwithstanding that acceptance of part of the account, the judge at [17] mischaracterises the respondent's case before the Tribunal by wrongly asserting that respondent did not accept that appellant had been 'a smuggler in the border region.' 6. Fourthly, in his analysis of the appellant's account, the judge unreasonably finds against the appellant in part because he was unable to produce corroborative evidence of parts of his account. I accept that it was reasonable for the judge to note that the appellant had not produced evidence from PJAK representatives in Iran or the United Kingdom to endorse his claim to be a supporter of that organisation but the judge did err at [20.4] when he indicates that the credibility of the account is diminished because there was 'no supporting evidence to show that [the appellant] had been ambushed whilst portering PJAK goods and his accompanying cousin wounded and arrested.' The judge makes no attempt to specify what 'supporting evidence' he expects to be produced of this event which, by its nature, is unlikely to have been reported in the media whilst those who witnessed it are unlikely to be willing or able to provide evidence in court proceedings in the United Kingdom. 7. In the light of what I have said above, I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. The errors go to the core of the Tribunal's analysis of credibility; in the circumstances, it will be necessary to return the appeal to a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.Notice of DecisionThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 19 December 2018 is set aside. None of the findings of fact shall stand. The decision is returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judge Drake) for that Tribunal to remake the decision at or following a hearing.Signed Date 30 May 2019Upper Tribunal Judge Lane",2019-06-03
